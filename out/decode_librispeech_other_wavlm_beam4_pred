7902-96591-0000	i'm from the cutter lying off the coast
7902-96591-0001	don't cry he said i was obliged to come
7902-96591-0002	and and you have not found out anything came in quick frightened tones
7902-96591-0003	i wish you would believe me that i am in as great trouble about it as you are
7902-96591-0004	that my father sir risdon graeme had smuggled goods here
7902-96591-0005	he could not help it he hates the smugglers you shall not tell
7902-96591-0006	pray pray say you will not archie was silent
7902-96591-0007	then as archie stood in the dark literally aghast with astonishment he heard the faint rustling once more and again all was silent
7902-96591-0008	he laughed but it was a curious kind of laugh full of vexation injured amour propre as the french call our love of our own dignity of which archibald raystoke in the full flush of his young belief in his importance as a british officer had a pretty good stock
7902-96591-0009	and all comes of dressing up in this stupid way like a rough fisher lad
7902-96591-0010	cold water came on this idea directly as he recalled the fact that the darkness was intense and celia could not have seen him
7902-96591-0011	i'll soon show them that i am not going to be played with
7902-96591-0012	for it suddenly occurred to him that he was not only a prisoner but a prisoner in the power of a very reckless set of people who would stop at nothing
7902-96591-0013	no he thought to himself i don't believe they would kill me but they would knock me about
7902-96591-0014	the kick he had received was a foretaste of what he might expect and after a little consideration he came to the conclusion that his duty was to escape and get back to the cutter as quickly as he could
7902-96591-0015	to do this he must scheme lie hid till morning then make for the nearest point and signal for help unless a boat's crew were already searching for him how to escape
7902-96591-0016	the window was barred but he went to it and tried the bars one by one to find them all solidly fitted into the stone sill
7902-96591-0017	next moment as he felt his way about his hand touched an old fashioned marble mantelpiece fireplace chimney
7902-96591-0018	yes if other ways failed he could escape up the chimney
7902-96591-0019	no that was too bad he could not do that
7902-96591-0020	sympathy and pity for the dwellers in the hoves were completely gone now and he set his teeth fast and mentally called himself a weak idiot for ever thinking about such people
7902-96591-0021	a narrow table against the wall in two places
7902-96591-0022	he went and tried to force his head through recalling as he did that where a person's head would go the rest of the body would pass
7902-96591-0023	but there was no chance for his body there and the head would not go first
7902-96591-0024	a fellow who was shut up in prison for life might do it he said but not in a case like this
7902-96592-0000	sure you've looked round everywhere boy yes father quite
7902-96592-0001	i'm going home on the breakfast
7902-96592-0002	shall i come too father no
7902-96592-0003	stop here till sir risdon comes down and tell him i'm very sorry that we should have cleared out last night only a born fool saw jerry nandy's lobster boat coming into the cove and came running to say it was a party from the cutter yes father
7902-96592-0004	tell him not to be uneasy tis all right and i'll have everything clear away to night
7902-96592-0005	the dull sound of departing steps and a low whistling sound coming down through the skylight window into the cabin where archie raystoke lay with his heavy eyelids pressed down by sleep
7902-96592-0006	what a queer dream he thought to himself
7902-96592-0007	but how queer for mister gur to be talking like that to andrew teal the boy who helped the cook
7902-96592-0008	and why did andy call mister gear father
7902-96592-0009	there was an interval of thinking over this knotty question during which the low whistling went on
7902-96592-0010	and i'm hungry too time i was up i suppose
7902-96592-0011	no he was not dreaming for he was looking out on the sea over which a faint mist hung like wreaths of smoke
7902-96592-0012	what did they say false alarm tell sir risdon they would clear all away to night see if anything had been left about lobster boat
7902-96592-0013	once out of that room he could run and by daylight the smugglers dare not hunt him down
7902-96592-0014	oh those bars he mentally exclaimed and he was advancing towards them just as he drew near there was a rustling noise under the window a couple of hands seized the bars there was a scratching of boot toes against stonework and rams face appeared to gaze into the room by intention but into the astonished countenance of the young midshipman instead
7902-96592-0015	rey was the first to recover from his surprise
7902-96592-0016	hello he said who are you
7902-96592-0017	go round and open the door i was shut in last night by mistake
7902-96592-0018	i saw you last night and wondered whose boy you was
7902-96592-0019	it was you father kicked for shirking and my well i hardly know you
7902-96592-0020	nonsense
7902-96592-0021	won't do said rim gripping
7902-96592-0022	think i don't know you mister orfferer
7902-96592-0023	won't do said reym quickly i know you
7902-96592-0024	been playing the spy that's what you've been doing who locked you in
7902-96592-0025	archie stepped back to the door listening but there was not a sound
7902-96592-0026	he has gone to give the alarm thought the prisoner and he looked excitedly round for a way of escape
7902-96592-0027	nothing but the chimney presented itself
7902-96592-0028	a happy inspiration had come and placing one hand upon his chest he thrust in the other gave a tug and drew out his little curved dirk glanced at the edge ran to the window and began to cut at one of the bars labor in vain
7902-96592-0029	he divided the paint and produced a few squeaks and grating sounds as he realized that the attempt was madness
7902-96592-0030	the result was not very satisfactory but sufficiently so to make him essay the bar of the window once more producing a grating irascible sound as he found that now he did make a little impression so little though that the probability was if he kept on working well for twenty four hours he would not get through
7902-96592-0031	but at the end of five minutes he stopped and thrust back the dirt into its sheath
7902-96592-0032	no i can't part with that ha ha ha laughed the boy jeeringly
7902-96592-0033	but i'll yes i'll give you a guinea if you will let me out
7902-96592-0034	guiney said the boy think i'll do it for a guiney well then too
7902-96592-0035	be quick there's a good fellow i want to get away at once
7902-96592-0036	not you only a sham
7902-96592-0037	why your clothes don't fit you and your cap's put on all skeeroo
7902-96592-0038	never mind about that let me out of this place
7902-96592-0039	i told you a fisher boy cried archie impatiently but trying not to offend his visitor who possessed the power of conferring freedom by speaking sharply
7902-96592-0040	not you look like a wild beast in a cage like a monkey you insolent
7902-96592-0041	archie checked himself and the boy laughed
7902-96592-0042	it was your turn yesterday it's mine to day what a game
7902-96592-0043	you laughed and flattered at me when i was on the cutter's deck
7902-96592-0044	i say you do look like a remon just like a big monkey in a show
7902-96592-0045	raam showed his white teeth as he burst out with a long low fit of laughter
7902-96592-0046	you rope's end me he said
7902-96592-0047	why i could tie you up in a knot and heave you off the cliff any day what a game
7902-96592-0048	bit of a meddy fed on a salt tack and weevily biscuit talk of giving me ropes end
7902-96592-0049	once more will you come and let me out no
7902-96592-0050	to his astonishment the boy did not flinch but thrust his own arms through placing them about the meddy's waist clenching his hand behind and uttering a sharp whistle
7902-96594-0000	seemed good spirits last night mister gurney hey
7902-96594-0001	yes sir but he may turn up on the cliff at any moment

7902-96594-0008	well sir said the master hesitating smugglers are smugglers
7902-96594-0009	certainly sir smugglers are smugglers indeed

7902-96594-0020	then what did you mean speak out and don't do the double shuffle all over my clean deck no sir
7902-96594-0021	hopping about like a cat on hot bricks
7902-96594-0022	now then why do you want to go ashore
7902-96594-0023	they beg pardon didn't mean now sir said the sailor touching his forelock
7902-96594-0024	yes sir said the man humbly shall i go at once sir
7902-96594-0025	no wait
7902-96594-0026	keep a sharp look out on the cliff to see if mister raystoke is making signals for a boat
7902-96594-0027	he swung round walked aft and began sweeping ashore again with his glass while the master and dike exchanged glances which meant a great deal
7902-96594-0028	at last the little lieutenant could bear the excitement no longer
7902-96594-0029	pipe away the men to that boat there he said and as the crew sprang in
7902-96594-0030	now mister granger he said i'm only going to say one thing to you in the way of instructions yes sir
7902-96594-0031	beg pardon sir said the master deprecatingly
7902-96594-0032	steady my lad steady cried the master keep stroke and then he began to make plans as to his first proceedings on getting ashore
7902-96595-0000	say mister gerk said dick after one of these searches he wouldn't run away what
7902-96595-0001	mister raystoke sir don't be a fool
7902-96595-0002	what check them off yonder
7902-96595-0003	ger glanced round to see if the men were looking and then said rather huskily but kindly
7902-96595-0004	ah ejaculated dick sadly
7902-96595-0005	say mister gresham which thankful i am for you for speaking so but you don't really think as he has come to harm
7902-96595-0006	i hope not dick i hope not but smugglers don't stand anything sometimes
7902-96595-0007	i do assure you there's nothing here but what you may see
7902-96595-0008	if you let me finish you'd know said gurgle gruffly one of our boys is missing seen em up there
7902-96595-0009	boy about seventeen with a red cap no sir indeed we have none
7902-96595-0010	don't know as he has been seen about here do you said gower looking at her searchingly no sir
7902-96595-0011	if she knew evil had come to the poor lad her face would tell tales like print
7902-96595-0012	i said a lad about seventeen and a red cap like yours said gur very shortly
7902-96595-0013	the man shook his head and stared as if he didn't half understand the drift of what was said
7902-96595-0014	here my lad where's your master
7902-96595-0015	eh i say where's your master
7902-96595-0016	curtis turned away impatiently again and signing to his men to follow they all began to tramp up the steep track leading towards the hoses with the rabbits scuttling away among the firs and showing their white cotton tails for a moment as they darted down into their holes
7902-96595-0017	i don't know muttered dick and a man can't be sure
7902-96595-0018	gur soluted and stated his business while the baronet who had turned sallow and more care worn than his lot drew a breath of full of relief one of your ship boys he said
7902-96595-0019	a lad looking like a common sailor and wearing a red cap no said sir isidore
7902-96595-0020	i have seen no one answering to the description here
7902-96595-0021	beg pardon sir but can you as a gentleman assure me that he is not here certainly said sir widerman
7902-96595-0022	surely cried sir wesden excitedly
7902-96595-0023	sir richard was silent
7902-96595-0024	lady graham looked ghastly
7902-96595-0025	you do not know no
7018-75788-0000	then i took up a great stone from among the trees and coming up to him smote him therewith on the head with all my might and crushed in his skull as he lay dead drunk
7018-75788-0001	behold a ship was making for the island through the dashing sea and clashing waves
7018-75788-0002	hearing this i was sore troubled remembering what i had before suffered from the ape kind
7018-75788-0003	upon this he brought me a cotton bag and given it to me said take this bag and fill it with pebbles from the beach and go forth with the company of the townsfolk to whom i will give a charge respecting thee
7018-75788-0004	do as they do and be like thou shalt gain what may further thy return voyage to thy native land
7018-75788-0005	then he carried me to the beach where i filled my bag with pebbles large and small and presently we saw a company of folk issue from the town each bearing a bag like mine filled with pebbles
7018-75788-0006	to these he committed me commending me to their care and saying this man is a stranger so take him with you and teach him how to gather that he may get his daily bread and you will earn your reward and recompense in heaven
7018-75788-0007	now sleeping under these trees were many apes which when they saw us rose and fled from us and swarmed up among the branches whereupon my companions began to pelt them with what they had in their bags and the apes fell to plucking of the fruit of the trees and casting them at the folk
7018-75788-0008	we weighed anchor and shahrazad perceived the dawn of the day and ceased saying her permitted say
7018-75788-0009	when it was the five hundred and fifty ninth night
7018-75788-0010	and ceased not sailing till we arrived safely at bussorah
7018-75788-0011	there i abode a little and then went on to baghdad where i entered my quarter and found my house and gathered with my family and saluted my friends who gave me joy of my safe return and i laid up all my goods and valuables in my storehouses
7018-75788-0012	after which i returned to my old merry way of life and forgot all i had suffered in the great profit and gain i had made
7018-75788-0013	next morning as soon as it was light he prayed the dawn prayer and after blessing mahomet the cream of all creatures betook himself to the house of sinbad the seaman and wished him a good day
7018-75788-0014	here i found a great ship ready for sea and full of merchants and notables who had with them goods of price so i embarked my bales therein
7018-75788-0015	happily amongst you is one righteous whose prayers the lord will accept
7018-75788-0016	presently the ship struck the mountain and broke up and all and everything on board of her were plunged into the sea
7018-75788-0017	but it burneth in their bellies so they cast it up again and it congealeth on the surface of the water whereby its colour and quantities are changed and at last the waves cast it ashore and the travellers and merchants who know it collect it and sell it
7018-75788-0018	each that died we washed and shrouded in some of the clothes and linen cast ashore by the tides and after little the rest of my fellows perished one by one till i had buried the last of the party and abode alone on the island with but a little provision left i who was wont to have so much
7018-75788-0019	but there is majesty and there is no might save in allah the glorious the great
7018-75789-0000	when it was the five hundred and sixty first night
7018-75789-0001	then signing for myself i set to work collecting a number of pieces of chinese and korean and alabaster wood and i bound them together with ropes from the wreckage then i chose out from the broken up ships straight planks of even size and fixed them firmly upon the alabaster wood making me a boat raft a little narrower than the channel of the stream and i tied it tightly and firmly as though it were nailed
7018-75789-0002	land after land shalt thou seek and find but no other life on thy wish shall wait fret not thy soul in thy thoughts are night all woes shall end or sooner or late
7018-75789-0003	i rowed my conveyance into the place which was intensely dark and the current carried the raft with it down the underground channel
7018-75789-0004	and i threw myself down upon my face on the raft by reason of the narrowness of the channel whilst the stream ceased not to carry me along knowing not night from day for the excess of the gloom which encompassed me about in my terror and concern for myself lest i should perish
7018-75789-0005	when i awoke at last i found myself in the light of heaven and opening my eyes i saw myself in a broad stream and the raft moored to an island in the midst of a number of indians and aborigines
7018-75789-0006	but i was delighted at my escape from the river
7018-75789-0007	when they saw i understood them not and made them no answer one of them came forward and said to me in arabic peace be with thee o my brother
7018-75789-0008	o my brother answered he we are husbandmen and tillers of the soil who came out to water our fields and plantations and finding thee asleep on this raft laid hold of it and made it fast by us against thou shouldest awake at thy leisure
7018-75789-0009	i answered for allah's sake o my lord ere i speak give me somewhat to eat for i am starving and after ask me what thou wilt
7018-75789-0010	when it was the five hundred and sixty second night
7018-75789-0011	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that sindbad the seaman continued when i landed and found myself amongst the indians and abissinians and had taken some rest they consulted among themselves and said to one another there is no help for it but we carry him with us and present him to our king that he may acquaint him with his adventures
7018-75789-0012	so i consulted with the chief of the islanders and they paid me the utmost respect
7018-75789-0013	so i rose without stay or delay and kissed the king's hand and acquainted him with my longing to set out with the merchants for that i pined after my people and mine own land
7018-75789-0014	quoth he thou art thine own master yet if it be thy will to abide with us on our head and eyes be it for thou gladdenest us with thy company
7018-75789-0015	by allah am my lord answered i thou hast indeed overwhelmed me with thy favors and well doings but i weary for a sight of my friends and family and native country
7018-75789-0016	then i took leave of him and of all my intimates and acquaintances in the island and embarked with the merchants afore said
7018-75789-0017	he asked me whence they came and i said to him by allah o commander of the faithful i know not the name of the city nor the way thither
7018-75789-0018	for state processions a throne is set for him upon a huge elephant eleven cubits high and upon this he sitteth having his great lords and officers and guests standing in two ranks on his right hand and on his left
7018-75789-0019	his letter hath shown me this and as for the mightiness of his dominion thou hast told us what thou hast i witnessed
7018-75789-0020	presently my friends came to me and i distributed presents among my family and gave alms and largesse after which i yielded myself to joyance and enjoyment mirth and merry making and forgot all that i had suffered
7018-75789-0021	such then o my brothers is the history of what befell me in my sixth voyage and to morrow in shalah
7018-75789-0022	i will tell you the story of my seventh and last voyage which is still more wondrous and marvellous than that of the first six
7018-75789-0023	when it was the five hundred and sixty third night
7018-75789-0024	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when sinbad the seaman had related the history of what befell him in his sixth voyage and all the company had dispersed sinbad the landsman went home and slept as of wont
7018-75789-0025	the seventh voyage of sinbad the seaman
7018-75789-0026	no o company that after my return from my sixth voyage which brought me abundant profit i resumed my former life in all possible joys and enjoyment and mirth and making merry day and night and i tarried some time in this solace and satisfaction till my soul began once more to long to sail the seas and see foreign countries and company with merchants and here new things
7018-75789-0027	so having made up my mind i packed up in bales a quantity of precious stuffs suited for sea trade and repaired with them from bagdad city to basra town where i found a ship ready for sea and in her a company of considerable merchants
7018-75789-0028	but the captain arose and tightening his girdle tucked up his skirts and after taking refuge with allah from satan the stoned climbed to the master's head where he looked out right and left and gazing at the passengers and crew fell to buffeting in his face and plucking out his beard
7018-75789-0029	this he set in a saucer watered with a little water and after waiting a short time smelt and tasted it and then he took out of the chest a booklet wherein he read a while and said weeping know o ye passengers that in this book is a marvelous matter denoting that whoso come hither shall surely die without hope of escape for that this ocean is called the sea of the clime of the king wherein is a sepulchre of our lord solomon son of david on both be peace
7018-75789-0030	a second fish made its appearance and which we had seen naught more monstrous
7018-75789-0031	when suddenly a violent squall of wind arose and smote the ship which rose out of the water and settled upon a great reef the haunt of sea monsters where it broke up and fell asunder into planks and all and everything on board were plunged into the sea
4198-12281-0000	although the plague was there in the most part of all the houses they nevertheless entered everywhere then plundered and carried away all that was within and yet for all this not one of them took any hurt which is a most wonderful case
4198-12281-0001	i beseech you think upon it
4198-12281-0002	nevertheless at all ventures they wrangled the bells ad caputulam capitulantas
4198-12281-0003	by the virtue of god why do not you sing panier's farewell ventage is done
4198-12281-0004	by the belly of saint james what shall we poor devils drink the while
4198-12281-0005	lord god damn me he potum
4198-12281-0006	let him be carried to prison for troubling the divine service
4198-12281-0007	wherefore is it that our devotions were instituted to be short in the time of harvest and vintage and long in the advent and all the winter
4198-12281-0008	hearken you my masters you that love the wine cop's body follow me for saint anthony burn me as freely as a faggot they get leave to taste one drop of the liquor that will not now come and fight for relief of the vine
4198-12281-0009	to others again he unjointed the spindles or knuckles of the neck disfigured their chaps gashed their faces made their cheeks hang flapping on their chin and so swung and belaboured them that they fell down before him like hay before him moor
4198-12281-0010	to some with their smart suits on the ebb gaster he would make their mid drift swag then redoubling the blow gave them such a home push on the nerve that he made their paddles to gush out

4198-61336-0000	it is significant to note in this connection that the new king was an unswvering adherent of the cult of asher by the adherence of which he was probably strongly supported
4198-61336-0001	at the beginning of his reign there was much social discontent and suffering
4198-61336-0002	well might chodurus exclaim in the words of the prophet where is the king of arpad
4198-61336-0003	tiglathpileser however crossed the euphrates and moving northward delivered an unexpected attack on the urartian army in kumuk
4198-61336-0004	a fierce battle ensued and one of its dramatic incidents was a single combat between the rival kings
4198-61336-0005	an attempt was made to capture king chandragupta who leaped from his chariot and made hasty escape on horseback hotly pursued in the gathering darkness by an assyrian contingent of cavalry
4198-61336-0006	despite the blow dealt against eureka assyria did not immediately regain possession of north syria
4198-61336-0007	the shifty menti ilu either cherished the hope that sharduris would recover strength and again invade north syria or that he might himself establish an empire in that region
4198-61336-0008	tiglath pileser had therefore to march westward again
4198-61336-0009	for three years he conducted vigorous campaigns in the western land where he met with vigorous resistance
4198-61336-0010	arpad was captured and menti ilu deposed and probably put to death
4198-61336-0011	once again the hebrews came into contact with assyria
4198-61336-0012	its fall may not have been unconnected with the trend of events in asia during the closing years of the middle empire
4198-61336-0013	george wash the grandson of jay had achieved successes in conflict with damascus
4198-61336-0014	six months afterward he was assassinated by shollem
4198-61336-0015	this usurer held sway at samaria for only a month
4198-61336-0016	no resistance was possible on the part of menahem the usurper who was probably ready to welcome the assyrian conqueror so that by arranging an alliance he might secure his own position
4198-61336-0017	tiglath pileser next operated against the median and other hill tribes in the north east
4198-61336-0018	he overthrew buildings destroyed orchards and transported to nivva those of the inhabitants he had not put to the sword with all the live stock he could lay hands on
4198-61336-0019	thus was uruta crippled and humiliated it never regained its former prestige among the northern states
4198-61336-0020	in the following year tiglath pileser returned to syria
4198-61336-0021	menahem king of israel had died and was succeeded by his son pecahiah
4198-61336-0022	judah had taken advantage of the disturbed conditions in israel to assert its independence
4198-61336-0023	he condemned israel for its idolatries and cried
4198-61336-0024	for thus saith the lord unto the house of israel seek ye me and ye shall live have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years o house of israel
4198-61336-0025	the remnant of the philistine shall perish
4198-61336-0026	israel was also dealt with
4198-61336-0027	he swept through israel like a hurricane
4198-61336-0028	the philistines and the arabians of the desert were also subdued
4198-61336-0029	he invaded babylonia
4198-61336-0030	ukena took refuge in his capital shapiya which held out successfully although the surrounding country was ravaged and despoiled
3080-5040-0000	would it leave me and then i could believe i shall not always have occasion for it
3080-5040-0001	my poor lady vavasour is carried to the tower and her great belly could not excuse her because she was acquainted by somebody that there was a plot against the protector and did not discover it
3080-5040-0002	she has told now all that was told her but vows she will never say from whence she had it we shall see whether her resolutions are as unalterable as those of my lady talmash
3080-5040-0003	i wonder how she behaved herself when she was married
3080-5040-0004	i never saw any one yet that did not look simply and out of countenance nor ever knew a wedding well designed but one and that was of two persons who had time enough i confess to contrive it and nobody to please but themselves
3080-5040-0005	the truth is i could not endure to be missus bride in a public wedding to be made the happiest person on earth
3080-5040-0006	do not take it ill for i would endure it if i could rather than fail but in earnest i do not think it were possible for me
3080-5040-0007	yet in earnest your father will not find my brother paton wanting in civility though he is not a man of much compliment unless it be in his letters to me nor an unreasonable person in anything so he will allow him out of his kindness to his wife to set a higher value upon her sister than she deserves
3080-5040-0008	my aunt told me no longer ago than yesterday that i was the most wilful woman that ever she knew and had an obstinacy of spirit nothing could overcome take heed
3080-5040-0009	you see i give you fair warning
3080-5040-0010	by the next i shall be gone into kent and my other journey's laid aside which i am not displeased at because it would have broken our intercourse very much
3080-5040-0011	here are some verses of cowley's tell me how you like them
3080-5040-0012	i told you in my last that my suffolk journey was laid aside and that into kent hastened
3080-5040-0013	if i drown by the way this will be my last letter and like a will i bequeath all my kindness to you in it with a charge never to bestow it all upon another mistress lest my ghost rise again and haunt you
3080-5040-0014	indeed i like him extremely and he is commended to me by people that know him very well and are able to judge for a most excellent servant and faithful as possible
3080-5040-0015	because you find fault with my other letters this is like to be shorter than they i did not intend it so though i can assure you
3080-5040-0016	i do not find it though i am told i was so extremely when i believed you loved me
3080-5040-0017	but i am called upon
3080-5040-0018	directed for your master
3080-5040-0019	i see you can chid when you please and with authority but i deserve it i confess and all i can say for myself is that my fault proceeded from a very good principle in me
3080-5040-0020	we dare not let our tongues lie more on one side of our mouths than the other for fear of overturning it
3080-5040-0021	you are satisfied i hope of this that i escape drowning
3080-5040-0022	but i am troubled much you should make so ill a journey to so little purpose indeed i wrote by the first post after my arrival here and cannot imagine how you came to miss of my letters
3080-5040-0023	how welcome you will be but alas
3080-5040-0024	for my life i cannot beat into their heads a passion that must be subject to no decree an even perfect kindness that must last perpetually without the least intermission
3080-5040-0025	they laughed to hear me say that one unkind word would destroy all the satisfaction of my life and that i should expect our kindness should increase every day if it were possible but never lessened
3080-5040-0026	we go abroad all day and play all night and say our prayers when we have time
3080-5040-0027	well in sober earnest now i would not live thus a twelvemonth to gain all that the king has lost unless it were to give it him again
3080-5040-0028	will you be so good natured
3080-5040-0029	he has one son and tis the finest boy that ever you saw and has a noble spirit but yet stands in that awe of his father that one word from him is as much as twenty whippings
3080-5040-0030	you must give me leave to entertain you thus with discourses of the family for i can tell you nothing else from hence
3080-5040-0031	not to know when you would come home i can assure you nor for any other occasion of my own but with a cousin of mine that had long designed to make herself sport with him and did not miss of her aim
3080-5040-0032	in my life i never heard so ridiculous a discourse as he made us and no old woman who passes for a witch could have been more puzzled to seek what to say to reasonable people than he was
3080-5040-0033	ever since this adventure i have had so great a belief in all things of this nature that i could not forbear laying a pea cock with nine peas in under my door yesterday we was informed by it that my husband's name should be thomas how do you like that
3080-5032-0000	but i am hugely pleased that you have seen my lady
3080-5032-0001	i knew you could not choose but like her but yet let me tell you you have seen but the worst of her
3080-5032-0002	her conversation has more charms than can be in mere beauty and her humor and disposition would make a deformed person appear lovely
3080-5032-0003	why did you not send me that news and a garland
3080-5032-0004	well the best on it is that i have a squire now that is as good as a knight
3080-5032-0005	in earnest we have had such a skirmish and upon so foolish an occasion as i cannot tell which is strangest
3080-5032-0006	all the people that i had ever in my life refused were brought again upon the stage like richard the third's ghosts to reproach me with and all the kindness his discoveries could make i had for you was laid to my charge
3080-5032-0007	my best qualities if i have any that are good served but for aggravations of my fault and i was allowed to have wit and understanding and discretion in other things that it might appear i had none in this
3080-5032-0008	tis a strange change and i'm very sorry for it but i'll swear i know not how to help it
3080-5032-0009	mister fish is a squire of dames and has so many mistresses that anybody may pretend to share in him and be believed but though i have the honour to be his near neighbour to speak freely i cannot brag much that he makes any court to me and i know no young woman in the country that he does not visit often
3080-5032-0010	i think my youngest brother comes down with him
3080-5032-0011	i can no sooner give you some little hints whereabout they live but you know them presently and i meant you should be beholding to me for your acquaintance
3080-5032-0012	but it seems this gentleman is not so easy access but you may acknowledge something due to me if i incline him to look graciously upon you and therefore there is not much harm done
3080-5032-0013	i have missed four fits and have had but five and have recovered so much strength as made me venture to meet your letter on wednesday a mile from home
3080-5032-0014	but besides i can give you others
3080-5032-0015	i am here much more out of people's way than in town where my aunt and such as pretend an interest in me and a power over me do so persecute me with their good nature and take it so ill that they are not excepted as i would live in a hollow tree to avoid them
3080-5032-0016	you will think him altered and if it be possible more melancholy than he was
3080-5032-0017	if marriage agrees no better with other people than it does with him i shall pray that all my friends may escape it
3080-5032-0018	well in earnest if i were a prince that lady should be my mistress but i can give no rule to anyone else and perhaps those that are in no danger of losing their hearts to her may be infinitely taken with one i should not value at all for so says the justinian wise providence has ordained it that by their different humors everybody might find something to please themselves with without envying their neighbours
3080-5032-0019	the matter is not grey for i confess i do naturally hate the noise and talk of the world and should be best pleased never to be known in it upon any occasion whatsoever yet since it can never be wholly avoided one must satisfy oneself by doing nothing that one needs care who knows
3080-5032-0020	if i had a picture that were fit for you you should have it
3080-5032-0021	how can you talk of defying fortune nobody lives without it and therefore why should you imagine you could
3080-5032-0022	i know not how my brother comes to be so well informed as you say but i am certain he knows the utmost of the injuries you have received from her
3080-5032-0023	we have had another debate but much more calmly
3080-5032-0024	and besides there was a time when we ourselves were indifferent to one another did i do so then or have i learned it since
3080-5032-0025	i have been studying how tom cheek might come by his intelligence and i verily believe he has it from my cousin peters
3080-5032-0026	how kindly do i take the civilities of your father's in earnest you cannot imagine how his letter pleased me
8280-266249-0000	old mister dinsmore had accepted a pressing invitation from his granddaughter and her husband to join the party and with the addition of servants it was a large one
8280-266249-0001	as they were in no haste and the confinement of a railroad car would be very irksome to the younger children it had been decided to make the journey by water
8280-266249-0002	there were no sad leave takings to mar their pleasure the children were in wild spirits and all seemed cheerful and happy as they sat or stood upon the deck watching the receding shore as the vessel steamed out of the harbour
8280-266249-0003	at length the land had quite disappeared nothing could be seen but the sky overhead and a vast expanse of water all round and the passengers found leisure to turn their attention upon each other
8280-266249-0004	there are some nice looking people on board remarked mister travellar in an undertone to his wife
8280-266249-0005	besides ourselves added cousin ronald laughing
8280-266249-0006	yes she answered that little group yonder a young minister and his wife and child i suppose
8280-266249-0007	and what a dear little fellow he is just about the age of our herald i should judge
8280-266249-0008	do you son was the smiling rejoinder
8280-266249-0009	he certainly looks like a very nice little boy
8280-266249-0010	suppose you and he shake hands frank
8280-266249-0011	i do indeed though probably comparatively few are aware that tobacco is the cause of their ailments
8280-266249-0012	doubtless that is the case remarked mister dinsmore
8280-266249-0013	with all my heart if you will step into the gentleman's cabin where there's a light
8280-266249-0014	he led the way the others all following and taking out a slip of paper read from it in a distinct tone loud enough to be heard by those all about him without disturbing the other passengers
8280-266249-0015	one drop of nicotine extracted to tobacco placed on the tongue of a dog will kill him in a minute the hundredth part of a grain pricked under the skin of a man's arm will produce nausea and fainting
8280-266249-0016	the half dozen cigars which most smokers use a day contain six or seven grains enough if concentrated and absorbed to kill three men and a pound of tobacco according to its quality contains from one quarter to one and a quarter ounces
8280-266249-0017	is it strange then that smokers and chewers have a thousand ailments
8280-266249-0018	that the french polytechnic institute had to prohibit its use on account of its effects upon the mind
8280-266249-0019	notice the multitude of sudden deaths and see how many are smokers and chewers
8280-266249-0020	in a small country town seven of these mysterious providences occurred within the circuit of a mile all directly traceable to tobacco and any physician on a few moments reflection can match this fact by his own observation
8280-266249-0021	and then such powerful acids produce intense irritation and thirst thirst which water does not quench
8280-266249-0022	hence the resort to cider and beer
8280-266249-0023	no sir what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and ye are not your own
8280-266249-0024	for you are bought with a price therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god's
8280-266249-0025	we certainly have no right to injure our bodies either by neglect or self indulgence
8280-266249-0026	and again i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice wholly acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service
8280-266249-0027	it must require a great deal of resolution for one who has become fond of the indulgence to give it up remarked mister dayley
8280-266249-0028	no doubt no doubt returned mister lilburn but if thy right eye offend thee plucket out and cast it from thee for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell
8280-266249-0029	there was a pause broken by young horace who had been watching a group of men gathered about a table at the further end of the room
8280-266249-0030	they're gambling yonder and i'm afraid that young fellow is being badly fleeced by the middle aged man opposite
8280-266249-0031	the eyes of the whole party were at once turned in that direction
8280-266249-0032	no sir he is not here
8280-266249-0033	and the door was slammed violently too
8280-266249-0034	now the voice came from the skylight overhead apparently and with a fierce imprecation the irate gamekeeper rushed upon deck and ran hither and thither in search of his tormentor
8280-266249-0035	his victim who had been looking on during the little scene and listening to the mysterious voice in silent wide eyed wonder and fear now rose hastily his face deathly pale with trembling hands gathered up the money he had staked and hurrying to his stateroom locked himself in
8280-266249-0036	what does it mean cried one
8280-266249-0037	i ventriloquist aboard of course returned another let's follow and see the fun
8280-266249-0038	i wonder which of us it is remarked the first looking hard at our party i don't know but come on
8280-266249-0039	that fellow nick ward is a noted blackleg and ruffian had his nose broken in a fight and is sensitive on the subject was cheating of course
8280-266249-0040	who asked the mate i've seen no one up here though there are some in the steerage
8280-266249-0041	they heard him in silence with a cool phlegmatic indifference most exasperating to one in his present mood
8280-266249-0042	a man of giant size and herculean strength had laid aside his pipe and slowly rising to his feet seized the scoundrel in his powerful grasp
8280-266249-0043	let me go yelled ward making a desperate effort to free his arms
8280-266249-0044	i doesn't know i doesn't know i did's you've von lesson returned his captain not relaxing his grasp in the least
8280-266249-0045	the german released his prisoner and the latter slunk away with muttered threats and imprecations upon the head of his tormentor
8280-266249-0046	mister lilburn and mister daly each at a different time sought out the young man world's intended victim and tried to influence him for good
8280-266249-0047	yet there was gambling again the second night between ward and several others of his profession
8280-266249-0048	they kept it up till after midnight
8280-266249-0049	then mister lilburn waking from his first sleep in a stateroom near by thought he would break it up once more
8280-266249-0050	an intense voiceless excitement possessed the players for the game was a close one and the stakes were very heavy
8280-266249-0051	they bent eagerly over the board each watching with feverish anxiety his companion's movements each casting now and again a gloating eye upon the heap of gold and greenbacks that lay between them and at times half stretching out his hand to clutch it
8280-266249-0052	a deep groan startled them and they sprang to their feet pale and trembling with sudden terror each holding his breath and straining his ear to catch a repetition of the dread sound
8280-266249-0053	but all was silent and after a moment of anxious waiting they sat down to their game again trying to conceal and shake off their fears with a forced unnatural laugh
8280-266249-0054	it came from under the table gasped ward look what's there look yourself
8280-266249-0055	what could it have been they asked each other
8280-266249-0056	oh nonsense what fools we are
8280-266249-0057	it was the last game of cards for that trip
8280-266249-0058	the captain coming in shortly after the sudden flight of the gamblers took charge of the money and the next day restored it to the owners
8280-266249-0059	to elsie's observant eyes it presently became evident that the dalys were in very straightened circumstances
8280-266249-0060	oh how kind how very kind missus daly said with tears of joy and gratitude we have hardly known how we should meet the most necessary expenses of this trip but have been trying to cast our care upon the lord asking him to provide
8280-266249-0061	and how wonderfully he has answered our petitions
8280-266249-0062	elsie answered pressing her hand affectionately are we not sisters in christ
8280-266249-0063	ye are all the children of god by faith in christ jesus
8280-266249-0064	ye are all one in christ jesus
8280-266249-0065	we feel my husband and i that we are only the stewards of his bounty and because he has said inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren ye have done it unto me it is the greatest privilege and delight to do anything for his people
5764-299665-0000	afterward it was supposed that he was satisfied with the blood of oxen lambs and doves and that in exchange for or in account of these sacrifices this god gave rain sunshine and harvest
5764-299665-0001	whether he was the creator of yourself and myself
5764-299665-0002	whether any prayer was ever answered
5764-299665-0003	why did he create the intellectually inferior
5764-299665-0004	why did he create the deformed and helpless why did he create the criminal the idiotic the insane
5764-299665-0005	are the failures under obligation to their creator
5764-299665-0006	he is responsible for all the wars that have been waged for all the innocent blood that has been shed
5764-299665-0007	is he responsible for the centuries of slavery for the backs that have been scarred with the lash for the babes that have been sold from the breasts of mothers for the families that have been separated and destroyed
5764-299665-0008	is this god responsible for religious persecution for the inquisition for the thumb screw and rack and for all the instruments of torture
5764-299665-0009	did this god allow the cruel and vile to destroy the brave and virtuous
5764-299665-0010	did he allow tyrants to shed the blood of patriots
5764-299665-0011	can we conceive of a devil base enough to prefer his enemies to his friends
5764-299665-0012	how can we account for the wild beasts that devour human beings for the fanged serpents whose bite is death
5764-299665-0013	how can we account for a world where life feeds on life
5764-299665-0014	did infinite wisdom intentionally produce the microscopic beasts that feed upon the optic nerves think of blinding a man to satisfy the appetite of a microbe
5764-299665-0015	fear builds the altar and offers the sacrifice
5764-299665-0016	fear erects the catatonic and bows the head of man in worship
5764-299665-0017	lips religious and fearful tremblingly repeat this passage though he slay me yet will i trust him
5764-299665-0018	can we say that he cared for the children of men
5764-299665-0019	can we say that his mercy endured forever
5764-299665-0020	do we prove his goodness by showing that he has opened the earth's and swallowed thousands of his helpless children or that with the volcanoes he has overwhelmed them with rivers of fire
5764-299665-0021	was their goodness was there wisdom in this
5764-299665-0022	ought the superior race to thank god that they are not the inferior
5764-299665-0023	most people clink to the supernatural
5764-299665-0024	if they give up one god they imagine another
5764-299665-0025	what is this power
5764-299665-0026	man advances and necessarily advances through experience
5764-299665-0027	a man wishing to go to a certain place comes to where the road divides
5764-299665-0028	he has tried that road and knows that it is the wrong road
5764-299665-0029	a child shorn by the beauty of the flame grasped it with his dimpled hand
5764-299665-0030	the power that works for righteousness had taught the child a lesson
5764-299665-0031	it is a result
5764-299665-0032	it is insisted by these theologians and by many of the so called philosophers that this moral sense this sense of duty of obligation was imported and that conscience is an exotic
5764-299665-0033	we live together in families tribes and nations
5764-299665-0034	they are praised admired and respected
5764-299665-0035	they are regarded as good that is to say as moral
5764-299665-0036	the members who add to the misery of the family the tribe or the nation are considered bad members
5764-299665-0037	the greatest of human beings had said conscience is born of love
5764-299665-0038	as people advance the remote consequences are perceived
5764-299665-0039	the imagination is cultivated
5764-299665-0040	a man puts himself in the place of another
5764-299665-0041	the sense of duty becomes stronger more imperative
5764-299665-0042	man judges himself
5764-299665-0043	in all this there is nothing supernatural
5764-299665-0044	man has deceived himself
5764-299665-0045	has christianity done good
5764-299665-0046	when the church had control were men made better and happier
5764-299665-0047	what has religion done for hungary or austria
5764-299665-0048	could these countries have been worse without religion
5764-299665-0049	could they have been worse had they had any other religion than christianity
5764-299665-0050	what did christianity do for them
5764-299665-0051	they hated pleasure
5764-299665-0052	they muffled all the bells of gladness
5764-299665-0053	the religion of the puritan was an unadulterated curse
5764-299665-0054	the puritan believed the bible to be the word of god and this belief has always made those who held it cruel and wretched
5764-299665-0055	let me refer to just one fact showing the influence of a belief in the bible on human beings
5764-299665-0056	the queen received the bible kissed it and pledged herself to diligently read therein
5764-299665-0057	in other words it was just as fiendish just as infamous as the catholic spirit
5764-299665-0058	has the bureau made the people of george kind and merciful
5764-299665-0059	religion has been tried and in all countries in all times has failed
5764-299665-0060	religion has always been the enemy of science of investigation and thought
5764-299665-0061	religion has never made men free
5764-299665-0062	it has never made man moral temperate industrious and honest
5764-299665-0063	are christians more temperate nearer virtuous nearer honest than savages
5764-299665-0064	can we cure disease by supplication
5764-299665-0065	can we receive virtue or honor as alms
5764-299665-0066	religion rests on the idea that nature has a master and that this master will listen to prayer that this master punishes and rewards that he loves praise and flattery and hates the brave and free
5764-299665-0067	we must have gone the stones
5764-299665-0068	the structure must have a basis
5764-299665-0069	if we build we must begin at the bottom
5764-299665-0070	i have a theory and i have four cornerstones
5764-299665-0071	the first stone is that matter substance cannot be destroyed cannot be annihilated
5764-299665-0072	if these cornerstones are facts it follows as a necessity that matter and force are from n to eternity that they can neither be increased nor diminished
5764-299665-0073	it follows that nothing has been or can be created that there never has been or can be a creator
5764-299665-0074	it followed that there could not have been any intelligence any design back of matter and force
5764-299665-0075	i say what i think
5764-299665-0076	every event has parents
5764-299665-0077	that which hath not happened could not
5764-299665-0078	in the infinite chain there is and there can be no broken no missing link
5764-299665-0079	we now know that our first parents were not foreigners
5764-299665-0080	we now know if we know anything that the universe is natural and that man and woman have been naturally produced
5764-299665-0081	we know the parts that life has travelled
5764-299665-0082	we know the footsteps of advance they have been traced
5764-299665-0083	for thousands of years men and women have been trying to reform the world
5764-299665-0084	why have the reformers failed
5764-299665-0085	they depend on the law on luck and charity
5764-299665-0086	they live by fraud and violence and bequeath their vices to their children
5764-299665-0087	failure seems to be the trade mark of nature why
5764-299665-0088	nature produced without purpose sustains without intention and destroys without thought
5764-299665-0089	must the world forever remain the victim of ignorant passion
5764-299665-0090	why should men and women have children that they cannot take care of children that are a burden and curses why
5764-299665-0091	passion is and always has been death
5764-299665-0092	law can punish but it can neither reform criminals nor prevent crime
5764-299665-0093	this cannot be done by talk or example
5764-299665-0094	this is the solution of the whole question
5764-299665-0095	this frees women
5764-299665-0096	poverty and crime will be childless
5764-299665-0097	it is far better to be free to leave the faults and barricades of fear to stand erect and face the future with the smile
6128-63240-0000	the gentleman had not even needed to sit down to become interested apparently he had taken up the volume from a table as soon as he came in and standing there after a single glance round the apartment had lost himself in its pages
6128-63240-0001	that has an unflattering sound for me said the young man
6128-63240-0002	she is willing to risk that
6128-63240-0003	just as i am the visitor inquired presenting himself with rather a workday aspect
6128-63240-0004	he was tall and lean and dressed throughout in black his shirt collar was low and wide and the triangle of linen a little crumpled exhibited by the opening of his waistcoat was adorned by a pin containing a small red stone
6128-63240-0005	in spite of this decoration the young man looked poor as poor as a young man could look who had such a fine head and such magnificent eyes
6128-63240-0006	those of basil ransom were dark deep and glowing his head had a character of elevation which fairly added to his stature it was a head to be seen above the level of the crowd on some judicial bench or political platform or even on a bronze medal
6128-63240-0007	these things the eyes especially with their smouldering fire might have indicated that he was to be a great american statesman or on the other hand they might simply have proved that he came from carolina or alabama
6128-63240-0008	and yet the reader who likes a complete image who desires to read with the senses as well as with the reason is entreated not to forget that his discourse was pervaded by something sultry and vast something almost african in its rich basking tone something that suggested the teeming expanse of the cotton field
6128-63240-0009	and he took up his hat vaguely a soft black hat with a low crown and an immense straight brim
6128-63240-0010	well so it is they're all witches and wizards mediums and spirit rappers and rowing radicals
6128-63240-0011	if you are going to dine with her you had better know it oh murder
6128-63240-0012	he looked at missus luna with intelligent incredulity
6128-63240-0013	she was attractive and impetuous especially the latter
6128-63240-0014	have you been in europe
6128-63240-0015	no i haven't been anywhere
6128-63240-0016	she hates it she would like to abolish it
6128-63240-0017	this last remark he made at a venture for he had naturally not devoted any supposition whatever to missus luna
6128-63240-0018	are you very ambitious you look as if you were
6128-63240-0019	and missus luna added that now she was back she didn't know what she should do
6128-63240-0020	one didn't even know what one had come back for
6128-63240-0021	besides olive didn't want her in boston and didn't go through the form of saying so
6128-63240-0022	that was one comfort with olive she never went through any forms
6128-63240-0023	she stood there looking consciously and rather seriously at mister ransom a smile of exceeding faintness played about her lips it was just perceptible enough to light up the native gravity of her face
6128-63240-0024	her voice was low and agreeable a cultivated voice and she extended the slender white hand to her visitor who remarked with some solemnity he felt a certain guilt of participation in missus loone's indiscretion that he was intensely happy to make her acquaintance
6128-63240-0025	he observed that miss chancellor's hand was at once cold and limp she merely placed it in his without exerting the smallest pressure
6128-63240-0026	i shall be back very late we're going to a theatre party that's why we dine so early
6128-63240-0027	missus lune's familiarity extended even to her sister she remarked to miss chansler that she looked as if she were got up for a sea voyage
6128-63244-0000	miss chancellor herself has thought so much on the vital subject would not she make a few remarks and give them some of her experiences
6128-63244-0001	how did the ladies on beacon street feel about the ballot
6128-63244-0002	perhaps she could speak for them more than for some others
6128-63244-0003	with her immense sympathy for reform she found herself so often wishing that reforms were a little different
6128-63244-0004	olive hated to hear that fine avenue talked about as if it were such a remarkable place and to live there were a proof of worldly glory
6128-63244-0005	all sorts of inferior people live there and so brilliant a woman as missus fernander who lived at ruxbury ought not to mix things up
6128-63244-0006	she knew her place in the boston hierarchy and it was not what missus forrester supposed so that there was a want of perspective in talking to her as if she had been a representative of the aristocracy
6128-63244-0007	she wished to work in another field she had long been preoccupied with the romance of the people
6128-63244-0008	this might seem one of the most accessible of pleasures but in point of fact she had not found it so
6128-63244-0009	charlie was a young man in a wide overcoat and a paper collar it was for him in the last analysis that they cared much the most
6128-63244-0010	lady chancellor wondered how missus fearing would treat the branch of the question
6128-63244-0011	if it be necessary we're prepared to take certain steps to conciliate the shrinking
6128-63244-0012	our movement is for all it appeals to the most delicate ladies
6128-63244-0013	raise the standard among them and bring me a thousand names
6128-63244-0014	and look after the details as well as the big currents missus fernander added in a tone as explanatory as could be expected of such a woman and with a smile of which the sweetness was thrilling to her listener
6128-63244-0015	said alfred chancellor with a face which seemed to plead for a remission of responsibility
6128-63244-0016	i want to be near to them to help them
6128-63244-0017	it was one thing to choose for herself but now the great representative of the enfranchisement of the sex from every form of bondage had chosen for her
6128-63244-0018	the unhappiness of women
6128-63244-0019	they were her sisters they were her own and the day of their delivery had dawned
6128-63244-0020	this was the only sacred cause this with the great the just revolution it must triumph it must sweep everything before it it must exact from the other the brutal bloodstained ravaging race the last particle of expiation
6128-63244-0021	there would be names of women weak insulted persecuted but devoted in every part of their being to the cause and asking no better fate than to die for it
6128-63244-0022	it was not clear to this interesting girl in what manner such a sacrifice as this last would be required of her but she saw the matter through a kind of sunny mist of emotion which made danger as rosie is success
6128-63244-0023	when miss birdseye approached it transfigured her familiar her comical shape and made the poor little humanity hack seem already a martyr
6128-63244-0024	olive chancellor looked at her with love remembered that she had never in her long and rewarded weary life had a thought or an impulse for herself
6128-63244-0025	she had been consumed by the passion of sympathy it had crumpled her into as many creases as an old glazed distended glove
6128-63241-0000	po ransom announced this fact to himself as if he had made a great discovery but in reality he had never been so biosion as at that moment
6128-63241-0001	the women he had hitherto known had been mainly of his own soft clime and it was not often they exhibited the tendency he detected and cursorily deplored in missus luna's sister
6128-63241-0002	ransom was pleased with the vision of that remedy it must be repeated that he was very provincial
6128-63241-0003	he was sorry for her but he saw in a flash that no one could help her that was what made her tragic
6128-63241-0004	she could not defend herself against the rich admiration a kind of tenderness of envy of anyone who had been so happy as to have that opportunity
6128-63241-0005	his family was ruined they had lost their slaves their property their friends and relations their home had tasted of all the cruelty of defeat
6128-63241-0006	the state of mississippi seemed to him the state of despair so he surrendered the remnants of his patrimony to his mother and sisters and at nearly thirty years of age elighted for the first time in new york in the costume of his province with fifty dollars in his pocket and a gnawing hunger in his heart
6128-63241-0007	it was in the female line as bazil ransome had written in answering her letter with a good deal of form and flourish he spoke as if they had been royal houses
6128-63241-0008	if it had been possible to send missus ransom money or even clothes she would have liked that but she had no means of ascertaining how such an offering would be taken
6128-63241-0009	olivier had a fear of everything but her greatest fear was of being afraid
6128-63241-0010	she had erected it into a sort of rule of conduct that whenever she saw a risk she was to take it and she had frequent humiliations at finding herself safe after all
6128-63241-0011	she was perfectly safe after writing to bazaar ransom and indeed it was difficult to see what he could have done to her except thank her he was only exceptionally superlative for her letter and assure her that he would come and see her the first time his business he was beginning to get a little should take him to boston
6128-63241-0012	he was too simple too messianic for that she was almost disappointed
6128-63241-0013	of all things in the world contention was most sweet to her the why it is hard to imagine for it always cost her tears headaches a day or two in bed acute emotion and it was very possible baedeker would not care to contend
5484-24317-0000	when he came from the bath proclus visited him again
5484-24317-0001	but harmon was not in the mood to share a joyous revel and he frankly said so although immediately after his return he had accepted the invitation to the festival which the whole fellowship of artists would give the following day in honor of the seventieth birthday of the old sculptor euphranor
5484-24317-0002	she would appear herself at dessert and the banquet must therefore begin at an unusually early hour
5484-24317-0003	so the artist found himself obliged to relinquish his opposition
5484-24317-0004	the bankruptcy was to begin in a few hours yet he could not let the day pass without seeing daphne and telling her the words of the oracle
5484-24317-0005	he longed with ardent yearning for the sound of her voice and still more to unburden his sorely troubled soul to her
5484-24317-0006	since his return from the oracular the fear that the rescued demetrius might yet be the work of martilus had again mastered him
5484-24317-0007	the approval as well as the doubts which had arisen in others strengthened his opinion although even now he could not succeed in bringing it into harmony with the facts
5484-24317-0008	then he went directly to the neighboring palace the queen might have appeared already and it would not do to keep her waiting
5484-24317-0009	hitherto the merchant had been induced it is true to advance large sums of money to the queen but the loyal devotion which he showed to her royal husband had rendered it impossible to give him even a hint of the conspiracy
5484-24317-0010	when hermon entered the residence of the grammaticius in the palace the guests had already assembled
5484-24317-0011	the place by hermon's side which althea had chosen for herself would then be given up to arsenio
5484-24317-0012	true an interesting conversation still had power to charm him but often during its continuance the full consciousness of his misfortune forced itself upon his mind for the majority of the subjects discussed by the artists came to them through the medium of sight and referred to new creations of architecture sculpture and painting from whose enjoyment his blindness debarred him
5484-24317-0013	a stranger out of his own sphere he fell chilled among these closely united men and women to whom no tie bound him save the presence of the same host
5484-24317-0014	kreidt had really been invited in order to win him over to the queen's cause but charming fair haired nico had been commissioned by the conspirators to persuade him to sing arsene's praises among his professional associates
5484-24317-0015	his son had been the royal dame's first husband and she had deserted him to marry lysimachus the aged king of thrace
5484-24317-0016	the king's sister the object of his love cried harman incredulously
5484-24317-0017	we women are only as old as we look and the leeches and tiring women of this beauty of forty practice arts which give her the appearance of twenty five yet perhaps the king values her intellect more than her person and the wisdom of a hundred serpents is certainly united in this woman's head
5484-24317-0018	the three most trustworthy ones are here amintas the leader chrisippus and the admirable proclus
5484-24317-0019	let us hope that you will make this three leafed clover the luck promising four leafed one
5484-24317-0020	your uncle too has often with praise worthy generosity helped arsonio in many an embarrassment
5484-24317-0021	how long he kept you waiting from the first word concerning a work which justly transported the whole city with delight
5484-24317-0022	when he did finally summon you he said things which must have wounded you
5484-24317-0023	that is going too far replied hermon
5484-24317-0024	he winked at her and made a significant gesture as he spoke and then informed the blind artist how graciously arsonio had remembered him when she heard of the remedy by whose aid many a wonderful cure of blind eye had been made in roads
5484-24317-0025	the royal lady had inquired about him and his sufferings with almost sisterly interest and althea eagerly confirmed the statement
5484-24317-0026	harmon listened to the pair in silence
5484-24317-0027	the rodian was just beginning to praise arsenio also as a special friend and connoisseur of the sculptor's art when cates hermon's fellow student asked the blind artist in behalf of his beautiful companion why his dameter was placed upon a pedestal which to others as well as himself seemed too high for the size of the statue
5484-24317-0028	yet what mattered it even if these miserable people considered themselves deceived and pointed the finger of scorn at him
5484-24317-0029	a woman who yearns for the regard of all men and makes love a toy easily lessens the demands she imposes upon individuals
5484-24317-0030	only even though love has wholly disappeared she still claims consideration and althea did not wish to lose hermon's regard
5484-24317-0031	how indifferent you look but i tell you her deep blue eyes flashed as she spoke that so long as you was still a genuine creating artist the case was different
5484-24317-0032	though so loud a denial is written on your face i persist in my conviction and that no idle delusion ensnares me i can prove
5484-24317-0033	it was nay it could have been nothing else that very spider
5484-24318-0000	not a sound if you value your lives
5484-24318-0001	to offer resistance would have been madness for even harmon perceived by the loud clanking of weapons round them the greatly superior power of the enemy and they were acting by the orders of the king to the prison near the place of execution
5484-24318-0002	was he to be led to the executioners block
5484-24318-0003	what pleasure had life to offer him the blind man who was already dead to his art
5484-24318-0004	ought he not to greet his sudden end as a boon from the immortals
5484-24318-0005	did it not spare him a humiliation as great and painful as could be imagined
5484-24318-0006	whatever might await him he desired no better fate
5484-24318-0007	if he had passed into annihilation he hermon wished to follow him thither and annihilation certainly meant redemption from pain and misery
5484-24318-0008	but if he were destined to meet his mertillas and his mother in the world beyond the grave what had he not to tell them how sure he was of finding a joyful reception there from both
5484-24318-0009	the power which delivered him over to death just at that moment was not nemesis no it was a kindly deity
5484-24318-0010	yet it was no illusion that deceived him
5484-24318-0011	again he heard the beloved voice and this time it addressed not only him but with the utmost haste the commander of the soldiers
5484-24318-0012	sometimes with touching entreaty sometimes with imperious command she protested after giving him her name that this matter could be nothing but an unfortunate mistake
5484-24318-0013	lastly with earnest warmth she besought him before taking the prisoners away to permit her to speak to the commanding general philipus her father's guest who she was certain was in the palace
5484-24318-0014	cried hermon in grateful agitation but she would not listen to him and followed the soldier whom the captain detailed to guide her into the palace
5484-24318-0015	to morrow you shall confess to me who treacherously directed you to this dangerous path
5484-24318-0016	daphne again pleaded for the liberation of the prisoners but philipa silenced her with a grave exclamation the order of the king
5484-24318-0017	as soon as the captive artist was alone with the woman he loved he clasped her hand pouring forth incoherent words of the most ardent gratitude and when he felt her warmly return the pressure he could not restrain the desire to clasp her to his heart
5484-24318-0018	in spite of his deep mental distress he could have shouted aloud in his delight and gratitude
5484-24318-0019	he might now have been permitted to bind for ever to his life the woman who had just rescued him from the greatest danger but the confession he must make to his fellow artists in the polestar the following morning still sealed his lips yet in this hour he felt that he was united to her and ought not to conceal what awaited him so obeying a strong impulse he exclaimed you know that i love you
5484-24318-0020	i love you and have loved you always
5484-24318-0021	davvy exclaimed tenderly what more is needed
5484-24318-0022	but hermon with drooping head murmured to morrow i shall no longer be what i am now
5484-24318-0023	then daphne raised her face to his asking so the demeter is the work of myrtis
5484-24318-0024	what a terrible ordeal again awaits you
5484-24318-0025	and i fool blinded also in mind could be vexed with you for it
5484-24318-0026	bring this before your mind and everything else that you must accept with it if you consent when the time arrives to become mine conceal and palliate nothing
5484-24318-0027	soorakis intended to leave the city on one of his own ships that very day
5484-24318-0028	he himself on the way to expose himself to the malice and mockery of the whole city
5484-24318-0029	his heart contracted painfully and his solicitude about his uncle's fate increased when philipus informed him that the conspirators had been arrested at the banquet and headed by amyntes the rodian chrisippus and proclus had perished by the executioner's sword at sunrise
5484-24318-0030	besides he knew that the object of his love would not part from him without granting him one last word
5484-24318-0031	on the way his heart throbbed almost to bursting
5484-24318-0032	even daphne's image and what threatened her father and her with him receded far into the background
5484-24318-0033	he was appearing before his companions only to give truth its just due
5484-24318-0034	the egyptian obeyed and his master crossed the wide space strewn with sand and approached the stage which had been erected for the feastal performances even had his eyes retained the power of sight his blood was coursing so widely through his veins that he might perhaps have been unable to distinguish the statues around him and the thousands of spectators who crowded closely together richly garlanded their cheeks glowing with enthusiasm surrounded the arena hermon
5484-24318-0035	shouted his friend solon in joyful surprise in the midst of his painful walk hermon
5484-24318-0036	even while he believed himself to be the creator of the demeter he had been seriously troubled by the praise of so many critics because it had exposed him to the suspicion of having become faithless to his art and his nature
5484-24318-0037	honour to mortalis and his art but he trusted this noble feast assembled would pardon the unintentional deception and aid his prayers for recovery
2033-164915-0000	and also these
2033-164915-0001	then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit
2033-164915-0002	when the eunuch saw this case he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them waited till they should recover
2033-164915-0003	after a while they came to themselves and zu alaikum salam rejoiced with exceeding joy oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her and she repeated these verses
2033-164915-0004	accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the kan and what had happened to her with the badawi how the merchant had bought her at the time of buying how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the king their sire had sent and asked for her from sharkan
2033-164915-0005	but now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me
2033-164915-0006	the chamberlain called the castro and charged him to do accordingly so he replied i hear and i obey and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the storker till he found him in the rear of the caravan girding his ass and preparing for flight
2033-164915-0007	she said it hath reached me o auspicious king that when the stalker girted his ass for flight and bespake himself saying o would i knew what is become of him
2033-164915-0008	i believe he hath denounced me to the eunuch hence these pages at about me and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime
2033-164915-0009	why didst thou say i never repeated these couplets nor do i know who repeated them when it was thy companion
2033-164915-0010	but now i will not leave thee between this place and baghdad and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee
2033-164915-0011	twas as i feared the kameneel's discerning but unto allah we are all returning
2033-164915-0012	then the eunuch cried upon the pages saying take him off the ass
2033-164915-0013	and he answered i am the chamberlain of the emir of damascus king sharkan son of omar bin al numan lord of baghdad and of the land of korasan and i bring tribute and presents from him to his father in baghdad
2033-164915-0014	so fare ye forward no harm shall befall you till you join his grand wazir tan daan
2033-164915-0015	then he bade him be seated and questioned him and he replied that he was chamberlain to the emir of damascus and was bound to king omar with presents and the tribut of syria
2033-164915-0016	so it was agreed that we go to damascus and fetch thence the king's son sharkan and make him sultan over his father's realm
2033-164915-0017	and amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet zau al makan for quoth they his name be light of the place and he hath a sister nushat al zaman his's the delight of the time but they set out five years ago for al hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them
2033-164914-0000	replied he of a truth i heard him not and i wot him not and folks are all sleeping
2033-164914-0001	but she said whosoever thou seest awake he is the reciter
2033-164914-0002	then said the eunuch art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him
2033-164914-0003	rejoined the eunuch who then was the reciter point him out to me
2033-164914-0004	by allah replied the fireman i tell thee the truth
2033-164914-0005	tell me what happened quoth sa'alamakan
2033-164914-0006	what ails thee then that thou must needs recite verses seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue
2033-164914-0007	and he also proposed the two following distichs
2033-164914-0008	when usra alaikum salam heard the first improvisation she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and her sister and their willum home then she wept and cried to the eunuch and said to him woe to thee
2033-164914-0009	he who recited the first time hath recited the second time and i heard him hard by
2033-164914-0010	by allah and thou fetch him not to me i will assuredly rouse the chamberlain on thee and he shall beat thee and cast thee out
2033-164914-0011	but take these hundred dinars and give them to the sinner and bring him to me gently and do him no hurt
2033-164914-0012	return quickly and linger not
2033-164914-0013	when it was the seventy third night
2033-164914-0014	but the eunuch said i will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses for i dread returning to my lady without him
2033-164914-0015	now when the fireman heard these words he feared for zau al makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the eunuch by allah it was not i and i know him not
2033-164914-0016	so go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry whether he be near or far it will be i or some one i know and thou shalt not learn of him but by me
2033-164914-0017	then he kissed the eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away but the gastaldo fetched around and returning secretly came and stood behind the fireman fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings
2033-164914-0018	i say what made my ignominy whatever the bitter cup i drain far be from me thy land to flee nor will i bow to those who blame and for such love would deal me shame
2033-164914-0019	then said the eunuch to zau al makan peace be with thee o my lord
2033-164914-0020	o my lord continued the eunuch and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
2033-164914-0021	we will do thee no upright o my son nor wrong thee in aught but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress to receive her answer and return in weal and safety and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news
2033-164914-0022	then the eunuch went out to zau al mikan and said to him recite what verses thou knowest for my lady is here hard by listening to thee and after i will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition
2033-164916-0000	so he turned to the wazir dandan and said to him verily your tale is a wonder of wonders
2033-164916-0001	know o chief wazir that here where you have encountered me allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions for that his almighty will restoreth to you zawa maikhan and his sister nusad alzahman whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can
2033-164916-0002	when the minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said o cambridge tell me the tale of the twain and what befell them and the cause of their long absence
2033-164916-0003	zhao amakan bowed his head a while and then said i accept the position for indeed there was no refusing and he was certified that the chamberlain had counseled him well and wisely and set him on the right way
2033-164916-0004	then he added o my uncle how shall i do with my brother sharkan
2033-164916-0005	after a while the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of baghdad and korasan a conquering host like the pool tide sea and shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say
2033-164916-0006	when it was the seventy eighth night
2033-164916-0007	and in it o'er rejoiced at the accession of the light of the place
2033-164916-0008	lastly the minister went in and kissed the ground before zau al makan who rose to meet him saying welcome o wazir and sire's son's peer
2033-164916-0009	moreover the sultan commanded his wazir dan daun call a ten days halt of the army that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain
2033-164916-0010	he then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days
3331-159605-0000	she pulled her hair down turned her skirt back put her feet on the fender and took potter into her lap all of which arrangements signified that something very important had got to be thought over and settled
3331-159605-0001	the more proposals the more credit
3331-159605-0002	i've tried it and liked it and maybe this is the consequence of that night's fun
3331-159605-0003	just suppose it is true that he does ask me and i say yes
3331-159605-0004	what a spiteful thing i am
3331-159605-0005	i could do so much for all at home how i should enjoy that
3331-159605-0006	let me see how can i begin
3331-159605-0007	he has known her all her life and has a good influence over her
3331-159605-0008	now as polly was by no means a perfect creature i am free to confess that the old temptation assailed her more than once that week for when the first excitement of the docking reform had subsided she missed the pleasant little interviews that used to put a certain flavor of romance into her dull working days
3331-159605-0009	i don't think it was his wealth accomplishments or position that most attracted polly though these doubtless possessed a greater influence than she suspected
3331-159605-0010	it was that indescribable something which women are quick to see and feel in men who have been blessed with wise and good mothers
3331-159605-0011	this had an especial charm to polly for she soon found that this side of his character was not shown to every one
3331-159605-0012	lately this had changed especially towards polly and it flattered her more than she would confess even to herself
3331-159605-0013	at first she tried to think she could but unfortunately hearts are so contrary that they won't be obedient to reason will or even credit
3331-159605-0014	polly felt a very cordial friendship for mister sidney but not one particle of the love which is the only coin in which love can be truly paid
3331-159605-0015	this finished polly's indecision and after that night she never allowed herself to dwell upon the pleasant temptation which came in a guise particularly attractive to a young girl with the spice of the old eve in her composition
3331-159605-0016	when saturday came polly started as usual for a visit to becky and bess but couldn't resist stopping at the shores to leave a little parcel for fan for it was calling time
3331-159605-0017	a foolish little speech to make to a dark but you see polly was only a tender hearted girl trying to do her duty
3331-159605-0018	take hold of massa charlie's hand miss mammy and walk pretty like willie and flossy said the maid
3331-159605-0019	at a street corner a black eyed schoolboy was parting from a rosy faced school girl whose music roll he was reluctantly surrendering
3331-159605-0020	how he got there was never very clear to polly but there he was flushed and a little out of breath but looking so glad to see her that she had not the heart to be stiff and cool as she had fully intended to be when they met
3331-159605-0021	she really could not help it it was so pleasant to see him again just when she was feeling so lonely
3331-159605-0022	that is the way i get to the ross answered polly
3331-159605-0023	she did not mean to tell but his frankness was so agreeable she forgot herself
3331-159605-0024	but i know her better and i assure you that she does improve she tries to mend her faults though she won't own it and will surprise you some day by the amount of heart and sense and goodness she has got
3331-159605-0025	thank you no
3331-159605-0026	how lofty the park looks she said in great confusion
3331-159605-0027	asked the artful young man laying a trap into which polly immediately fell
3331-159605-0028	he was quicker to take a hint than she had expected and being both proud and generous resolved to settle the matter at once for polly's sake as well as his own
3331-159605-0029	so when she made her last buoyant remark he said quietly watching her face keenly all the while i thought so well i'm going out of town on business for several weeks so you can enjoy your little bit of country without being annoyed by me annoy
3331-159605-0030	she thought she had a good deal of the coquette in her and i've no doubt that with time and training she would have become a very dangerous little person but now she was far too transparent and straight forward by nature even to tell a white lie levy
3331-159605-0031	he was gone before she could do anything but look up at him with a remorseful face and she walked on feeling that the first and perhaps the only lover she would ever have had read his answer and accepted it in silence
3331-159605-0032	polly did not return to her familiar walk till she learned from minnie that uncle had really left town and then she found that his friendly company and conversation was what had made the way so pleasant after all
3331-159605-0033	working to and fro as usual what's the news with you
3331-159605-0034	perhaps she'll chill him
3331-159605-0035	utterly done with and laid upon the shelf
3331-159605-0036	minnie said the other day she wished she was a pigeon so she could paddle in the puddles and not fuss about wrappers
3331-159605-0037	now don't be affected polly but just tell me like a dear has not he proposed
3331-159605-0038	don't you think he means to
3331-159605-0039	truly truly fan
3331-159605-0040	i don't mean to be prying but i really thought he did
3331-159605-0041	well i always meant to try it if i got a chance and i have
3331-159605-0042	i just gave him a hint and he took it
3331-159605-0043	he meant to go away before that so then think his heart is broken or mind what sydy tetler say
3331-159605-0044	he understood and being a gentleman made no fuss
3331-159605-0045	but polly it would have been a grand thing for you
3331-159605-0046	i'm odd you know and prefer to be an independent spinner and teach music all my days
3331-159609-0000	never mind what the business was it suffices to say that it was a good beginning for a young man like tom who having been born and bred in the most conservative class of the most conceded city in new england needed just the healthy hearty social influences of the west to widen his views and make a man of him
3331-159609-0001	fortunately everyone was so busy with the necessary preparations that there was no time for romance of any sort and the four young people worked together as soberly and sensibly as if all sorts of emotions were not bottled up in their respective hearts
3331-159609-0002	pity that the end should come so soon but the hour did its work and went its way leaving a clearer atmosphere behind though the young folks did not see it then for their eyes were dim because of the parting steep must be
3331-159609-0003	if it had not been for two things i fear she never would have stood a summer in town but sydney often called till his vacation came and a voluminous correspondence with polly beguiled the long days
3331-159609-0004	tom wrote once a week to his mother but the letters were short and not very satisfactory for men never do tell the interesting little things that women best like to hear
3331-159609-0005	no i'm only tired had a good deal to do lately and the dull weather makes me just a trifle blue
3331-159609-0006	forgive me polly but i can't help saying it for it is there and i want to be as true to you as you were to me if i can
3331-159609-0007	i tried not to deceive myself but it does seem as if there was a chance of happiness for me
3331-159609-0008	thank heaven for that
3331-159609-0009	cried polly with the heartiest satisfaction in her voice
3331-159609-0010	poor polly was so taken by surprise that she had not a word to say
3331-159609-0011	none were needed her telltale face answered for her as well as the impulse which made her hide her head in the sofa cushion like a foolish ostrich when the hunters are after it
3331-159609-0012	once or twice but sort of chokingly and i thought it was only some little flirtation
3331-159609-0013	it was so stupid of me not to guess before
3331-159609-0014	it was so tender earnest and defiant that fanny forgot the defence of her own lover in admiration of polly's loyalty to hers for this faithful all absorbing love was a new revelation to fanny who was used to hearing her friends boast of two or three lovers a year and calculate their respective values with almost as much coolness as the young man discussed the fortunes of the girls they wished for but could not afford to marry
3331-159609-0015	i hope maria bailey's only thinks her she added softly for i could not bear to have him disappointed again
3331-159609-0016	said fanny turning hopeful all at once
3331-159609-0017	suppose i say a word to tom just inquire after his heart in a general way you know and give him a chance to tell me if there's anything to tell
3331-159609-0018	bear it people always do bear things somehow answered polly looking as if sentence had been passed upon her
3331-159609-0019	it was a very different wind from the last to both the girls
3331-159609-0020	if fanny wanted to show him what she could do toward making a pleasant home she certainly succeeded better than she suspected for in spite of many failures and discouragements behind the scenes the little house became a most attractive place to mister sydney at least for he was more the house friend than ever and seemed determined to prove that change of fortune made no difference to him
3331-159609-0021	she kept much at home when the day's work was done finding it pleasant to sit dreaming of a book or sewing alone than to exert herself even to go to the shores
3331-159609-0022	polly was not at all like herself that winter and those nearest to her saw and wondered at it most
3331-159609-0023	for ned was so absorbed in business that he ignored the whole baily question and left them in utter darkness
3331-159609-0024	fanny came walking in upon her one day looking as if she brought tidings of such great joy that she hardly knew how to tell them
3331-159609-0025	but if work baskets were gifted with powers of speech they could tell stories more true and tender than any we read
533-131564-0000	vanity hope i fear
533-131564-0001	mister and missus hotterly have been staying at to grosvenor a fortnight and as missus hargrave is still absent and the weather was remarkably fine i never passed the day without seeing my two friends milicent and esther either there or here
533-131564-0002	no unless you can tell me when to expect him home
533-131564-0003	i can't you don't want him do you
533-131564-0004	it is a resolution you ought to have formed long ago
533-131564-0005	we all have a bit of a liking for him at the bottom of our hearts though we can't respect him
533-131564-0006	no i'd rather be like myself bad as i am
533-131564-0007	never mind my plain speaking said i it is from the best of motives
533-131564-0008	but tell me should you wish your sons to be like mister huntingdon or even like yourself
533-131564-0009	oh no i couldn't stand that
533-131564-0010	fire and fury
533-131564-0011	now don't pour into a tempest at that
533-131564-0012	but hang it that's not my fault
533-131564-0013	not years for she's only five and twenty
533-131564-0014	what did you make of me and the children to be sure that were hurt to death between them
533-131564-0015	i know they are bless them
533-131564-0016	he followed me into the library
533-131564-0017	i sought out and put into his hands two of millican's letters one dated from london and written during one of his wildest seasons of reckless dissipation the other in the country during a lucid interval
533-131564-0018	the former was full of trouble and anguish not accusing him but deeply regretting his connection with his profligate companions abusing mister grimsby and others insinuating bitter things against mister huntinton and most ingenuously throwing the blame of her husband's misconduct on the other man's shoulders
533-131564-0019	i've been a cursed rascal god knows said he as he gave it a earthy squeeze but you see if i don't make amends for it damn me if i don't
533-131564-0020	if you intend to reform invoke god's blessing his mercy and this aid not his curse
533-131564-0021	god help me then for i'm sure i need it
533-131564-0022	where is millicent
533-131564-0023	nay not i said he turning around and pushing it towards me
533-131564-0024	millicent flew to thank me overwhelming with gratitude
533-131564-0025	cried she i couldn't have influenced him i'm sure by anything that i could have said
533-131564-0026	you never tried me milly said he
533-131564-0027	after that they will repair to their country home
533-1066-0000	when church yards yawn
533-1066-0001	i knew well enough that he might be carried thousands of miles in the box car locked in perhaps without water or food
533-1066-0002	i'm sure i kissed lily and i've had terrible moments since when i seemed to remember kissing mister jameson two in the excitement
533-1066-0003	fortunately warner and the detective were keeping bachelor hall in the lodge
533-1066-0004	out of deference to lily they washed their dishes once a day and they concocted queer messes according to their several abilities
533-1066-0005	miss eyns he said stopping me as i was about to go to my room upstairs how are your nerves to night
533-1066-0006	i have none i said happily
533-1066-0007	i mean he persisted do you feel as though you could go through with something rather unusual
533-1066-0008	the most unusual thing i can think of would be a peaceful night
533-1066-0009	something is going to occur he said
533-1066-0010	put on heavy shoes and some old dark clothes and make up your mind not to be surprised at anything
533-1066-0011	lily was sleeping the sleep of the just when i went upstairs and i hunted out my things cautiously
533-1066-0012	they were talking coherently together but when they came down they ceased
533-1066-0013	there were a few preparations to be made the locks to be gone over winters to be instructed as to renewed visibility and then after establishing the hall light we crept into the darkness through the front door and into the night
533-1066-0014	i asked no questions
533-1066-0015	once only somebody spoke and then it was an emphatic bit of profanity from doctor steward when he ran into a wire fence
533-1066-0016	i hardly know what i expected
533-1066-0017	the doctor was puffing somewhat when we finally came to a halt
533-1066-0018	i confessed that just at that minute even sunny side seemed a cheerful spot
533-1066-0019	in spite of myself i drew my breath in sharply
533-1066-0020	it was alex armed with two long handled spades
533-1066-0021	the doctor kept a keen look out but no one appeared
533-1066-0022	there's one thing sure i'll not be suspected of completeness
533-1066-0023	a doctor is generally supposed to be a handier at bearing folks than at digging them up
533-1066-0024	i held on to him frantically and somehow i got there and looked down
533-131556-0000	but how am i to get over the ten or twelve days that must yet elapse before they go
533-131556-0001	for none could endure me as he has done oh
533-131556-0002	the world stares me in the face like a guilty confession but it is true i hate him i hate him
533-131556-0003	i sometimes think i ought to give him credit for the good feeling he simulates so well and then again i think it is my duty to suspect him under the peculiar circumstances in which i am placed
533-131556-0004	i have done well to record them so minutely
533-131556-0005	they had taken themselves to their work i less to divert my mind than to deprecate conversation had provided myself with a book
533-131556-0006	i am too well acquainted with your character and conduct to feel any real friendship for you and as i am without your talent for dissimulation i cannot assume the appearance of it
533-131556-0007	open perusing this she turned scarlet and bit her lip
533-131556-0008	you may go millicent and she'll follow in a while millicent went
533-131556-0009	well you'll oblige me ellen continued she
533-131556-0010	ah you are suspicious
533-131556-0011	if i were suspicious i replied i should have discovered your infamy long before
533-131556-0012	i enjoy your monologue as well as you i answered steadily fixing my eyes on her and the freebury happens to be one of my favorite resorts
533-131556-0013	she colored again excessively and remained silent pressing her finger against her cheeks and gazing into the fire
533-131556-0014	i watched her a few moments with a feeling of malevolent gratification then moving towards the door i calmly asked if she had anything more to say
533-131556-0015	yes yes
533-131556-0016	suppose i do
533-131556-0017	she paused in evident disconcertion and perplexity mingled with anger she dared not show
533-131556-0018	i cannot renounce what is dearer than life she muttered in a low hurried tone
533-131556-0019	if you are generous here is a fitting opportunity for the exercise of your magnanimity if you are proud here am i your rival ready to acknowledge myself your debtor for an act of the most noble forbearance
533-131556-0020	i shall not tell him
533-131556-0021	give me no thanks it is not for your sake that i refrain
533-131556-0022	and millicent will we tell her
533-131556-0023	i would not for much that she should know the infamy and disgrace of her relation
533-131556-0024	you use hard words missus huntingdon but i can pardon you
533-131556-0025	how dare you mention his name to me
533-131562-0000	it seems very interesting love said he lifting his head and turning to where i stood wringing my hand in silent rage and anguish but it's rather long i look at it some other time and meanwhile i'll trouble you for your keys my dear what keys
533-131562-0001	the keys of your cabinet desk drawer and whatever else you possess said he rising and holding out his hand
533-131562-0002	the keeper of my vessel in fact was at that moment in the lock and the others were attached to it
533-131562-0003	now then sneered he we must have a confiscation of property
533-131562-0004	and putting the keys into his pocket he walked into the library
533-131562-0005	that and all replied the master and the things were cleared away
533-131562-0006	mister huntingdon then went upstairs
533-131562-0007	muttered he starting back she's very devil for a spit
533-131562-0008	i didn't say i'd broken it did i returned he
533-131562-0009	i shall put you up on a small monthly allowance in future for your own private expenses and you needn't trouble yourself any more about my concerns i shall look out for a steward my dear i won't expose you to temptation
533-131562-0010	and as for the household matters missus greaves must be very particular in keeping her accounts we must go up on an entirely new plan
533-131562-0011	what great discovery have you made now mister huntingdon
533-131562-0012	i intended to defraud you
533-131562-0013	not in money matters exactly it seems but it's best to keep out of the way of temptation
533-131562-0014	here benjamin entered the candles and there followed the brief interval of silence i sitting still in my chair and he standing with his back to the fire silently triumphing in my despair
533-131562-0015	i know that day after day such feelings would return upon me
533-131562-0016	i try to look to him and raise my heart to heaven but it will cleave to the dust
3528-168656-0000	she had even been in society before the revolution
3528-168656-0001	it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
3528-168656-0002	every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monsieur saint francois gave it to monsieur saint julien monsieur saint julien gave it to monsieur saint eusebius monsieur saint eusebius gave it to monsieur saint procopius et cetera et cetera
3528-168656-0003	and the schoolgirls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers frown
3528-168656-0004	it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
3528-168656-0005	the ruler of frontenac did not forbid this
3528-168656-0006	she would not show this object to anyone
3528-168656-0007	thus it furnished a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent
3528-168656-0008	some unique chaplet some authentic relic
3528-168656-0009	they lost themselves in conjectures
3528-168656-0010	when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
3528-168656-0011	he is resisting fluttering his tiny wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a saturnalian air
3528-168656-0012	moral love conquered by the colic
3528-168669-0000	the prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair
3528-168669-0001	we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
3528-168669-0002	father faulvent
3528-168669-0003	reverend mother do you know the chapel
3528-168669-0004	and you have been in the choir in pursuance of your duties two or three times
3528-168669-0005	there is a stone to be raised heavy
3528-168669-0006	the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
3528-168669-0007	the slab which closes the vault yes
3528-168669-0008	it would be a good thing to have two men for it
3528-168669-0009	a woman is never a man
3528-168669-0010	because dom mauban gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while morel's horace only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise morel's horace neither do i
3528-168669-0011	merit consists in working according to one's strength a cloister is not a dockyard
3528-168669-0012	and a woman is not a man but my brother is the strong one though
3528-168669-0013	and can you get a lever
3528-168669-0014	there is a ring in the stone
3528-168669-0015	i will put the lever through it
3528-168669-0016	that is good reverend mother i will open the vault
3528-168669-0017	will that be all no
3528-168669-0018	give me your orders very reverend mother
3528-168669-0019	fouquet we have confidence in you
3528-168669-0020	i am here to do anything you wish
3528-168669-0021	and to hold your peace about everything yes rovin' mother
3528-168669-0022	when the vault is open i will close it again
3528-168669-0023	but before that what reverend mother
3528-168669-0024	father fourven reverend mother
3528-168669-0025	you know that a mother died this morning
3528-168669-0026	no did you not hear the bell
3528-168669-0027	nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden really
3528-168669-0028	and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
3528-168669-0029	it was mother crucifixion
3528-168669-0030	three years ago madame de bassompierre a gens d'armes turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer ah
3528-168669-0031	the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church i know
3528-168669-0032	a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dining room more often
3528-168669-0033	hey more often
3528-168669-0034	what do you say
3528-168669-0035	i say more often more often than what
3528-168669-0036	reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
3528-168669-0037	but i did not say more often
3528-168669-0038	at that moment nine o'clock struck
3528-168669-0039	at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar said the prioress
3528-168669-0040	it cut more often short
3528-168669-0041	fouchelevent mopped his forehead
3528-168669-0042	in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles she will
3528-168669-0043	father forvent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion
3528-168669-0044	she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
3528-168669-0045	she gave us her last commands
3528-168669-0046	if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it she smiled
3528-168669-0047	there was something of paradise in that death
3528-168669-0048	fouchelevent thought that it was an oraison which she was finishing
3528-168669-0049	forcheville held his peace she went on
3528-168669-0050	i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
3528-168669-0051	fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
3528-168669-0052	she continued father forven
3528-168669-0053	yes reverend mother
3528-168669-0054	saint terence bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of parisites in the hope that passers by would spit on his tomb this was done
3528-168669-0055	the dead must be obeyed so be it
3528-168669-0056	for that matter no reverend mother
3528-168669-0057	father provost mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years that is just
3528-168669-0058	it is a continuation of her slumber
3528-168669-0059	so i shall have to nail up that coffin yes
3528-168669-0060	i am at the orders of the very reverend community
3528-168669-0061	the four mother presidents will assist you
3528-168669-0062	no in louring the coffin
3528-168669-0063	where into the vault
3528-168669-0064	fouchelevent started the vault under the altar
3528-168669-0065	under the altar but
3528-168669-0066	you will have an iron bar yes but
3528-168669-0067	you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring but
3528-168669-0068	the dead must be obeyed to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
3528-168669-0069	she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
3528-168669-0070	but it is forbidden
3528-168669-0071	oh i am a stone in your walls
3528-168669-0072	think father forven if she were to work miracles here
3528-168669-0073	what a glory of god for the community and miracles issue from tombs
3528-168669-0074	but reverend mother if the agent of the sanitary commission
3528-168669-0075	but the commissary of police
3528-168669-0076	schona d'maur one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar
3528-168669-0077	the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
3528-168669-0078	martin the eleventh general of the carthusians gave to his order this device stat crux dux voluptator orbis
3528-168669-0079	the priest who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the fluency of a dam which has broken away
3528-168669-0080	i have on my right benoist and on my left bernard who was bernard
3528-168669-0081	the first abbot of clervaix
3528-168669-0082	his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses forty six kings forty one queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years
3528-168669-0083	on one side saint barnard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
3528-168669-0084	god subordinated to the commissary of police such is the age silence faveron
3528-168669-0085	no one doubts the right of the monastery to sequester
3528-168669-0086	only fanatics and those in error deny it
3528-168669-0087	we live in times of terrible confusion
3528-168669-0088	we are ignorant and impious
3528-168669-0089	and then religion is attacked why
3528-168669-0090	because there have been bad priests because sagara bishop of gappa was the brother of solon bishop of embroma and because both of them followed mamal
3528-168669-0091	they persecute the saints
3528-168669-0092	they shut their eyes to the truth darkness is the rule
3528-168669-0093	the most ferocious beasts are beasts which are blind
3528-168669-0094	oh how wicked people are
3528-168669-0095	by order of the king signifies to day by order of the revolution
3528-168669-0096	one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead a holy death is prohibited
3528-168669-0097	gothier bishop of chalon held his own in this matter against otho duke of burgundy
3528-168669-0098	the priest took breath then turned to fauchelard
3528-168669-0099	you will close the coffin the sisters will carry it to the chapel
3528-168669-0100	the office for the dead will then be set
3528-168669-0101	but she will hear she will not listen
3528-168669-0102	besides what the cloister knows the world learns not
3528-168669-0103	a pause ensued
3528-168669-0104	you will remove your bell
3528-168669-0105	has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
3528-168669-0106	he will pay at four o'clock to day
3528-168669-0107	the peal which orders the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung
3528-168669-0108	but you do not understand any of the peels
3528-168669-0109	that is well father forven
3528-168669-0110	where will you obtain it
3528-168669-0111	i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden
3528-168669-0112	reverend mother what
3528-168669-0113	if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you a perfect turk
3528-168669-0114	you will do it as speedily as possible
3528-168669-0115	i cannot work very fast i am infirm that is why i require an assistant i limp
3528-168669-0116	everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
3528-168669-0117	i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community these are my orders i am to nail the coffin
3528-168669-0118	at eleven o'clock exactly i am to be in the chapel
3528-168669-0119	mother ascension will be there two men would be better
3528-168669-0120	however never mind i shall have my lever
3528-168669-0121	after which there will be no trace of anything
3528-168669-0122	the government will have no suspicion
3528-168669-0123	the empty coffin remains this produced a pause
3528-168669-0124	what is to be done with that coffin father provost
3528-168669-0125	it will be given to the earth empty
3528-168669-0126	ah lida exclaimed franchelval
3528-168669-0127	the ville stuck fast in his throat
3528-168669-0128	he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
3528-168669-0129	i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother that will produce the effect of a corpse
3528-168669-0130	i will make that my special business
7975-280057-0000	these hatreds were soon to make trouble for me of which i had never dreamed
7975-280057-0001	henry washington younger my father represented jackson county three times in the legislature and was also a judge of the county court
7975-280057-0002	my mother who was brescia forrest of independence was a daughter of richard forrest who fought under general andrew jackson at new orleans jackson county having been so named at my grandfather forrest's insistence
7975-280057-0003	i cannot remember when i did not know how to shoot
7975-280057-0004	my brother james was born january fifteenth eighteen forty eight john in eighteen fifty one and robert in december eighteen fifty three
7975-280057-0005	my eldest brother richard died in eighteen sixty
7975-280057-0006	my father was in the employ of the united states government and had the mail contract for five hundred miles
7975-280057-0007	he had started back to harrisonville in a buggy but was waylaid one mile south of westport a suburb of kansas city and brutally murdered falling out of his buggy into the road with three mortal bullet wounds
7975-280057-0008	miss washington wells and her son samuel on the road home from kansas city to lees summit recognized the body as that of my father
7975-280057-0009	miss wells stayed to guard the remains while her son carried the news of the murder to colonel peabody of the federal command who was then in camp at kansas city
7975-280057-0010	miss mcorkle jumped from the window of the house and escaped
7975-280057-0011	as the raiders left one of them shouted
7975-280057-0012	now old lady call on your protectors why don't you call on coe younger now
7975-280057-0013	every knot represented a human life
7975-280057-0014	but she failed to find the comfort she sought for annoyances continued in a more aggravated form
7975-280057-0015	two months after this incident the same persecutors again entered our home in the dead of the night and at the point of a pistol tried to force my mother to set fire to her own home
7975-280057-0016	i have always felt that the exposure to which she was subjected on this cruel journey too hard even for a man to take was the direct cause of her death
7975-280057-0017	from harrisonville she went to waverly where she was hounded continually
7975-280057-0018	one of the conditions upon which her life was spared was that she would report at leicester weekly
7975-280057-0019	one of my old school teachers whom i have never seen since the spring or summer of eighteen sixty two is stephen b elkins senator from west virginia
7975-280057-0020	when i was taken prisoner i expected to be shot without ceremony
7975-280076-0000	although every book reporting to narrate the lives of the younger brothers has told of the liberty robbery and implied that we had a part in it the youngers were not suspected at that time nor for a long time afterward
7975-280076-0001	it was claimed by people of liberty that they positively recognized among the robbers all shepherds red monkeys and bud pints who had seen service with contrelle
7975-280076-0002	this raid was accompanied by bloodshed judge mc lane the banker being shot though not fatally
7975-280076-0003	no warrant was issued for the youngers but subsequent historians have inferentially at least accused us of taking part but as i said before there is no truth in the accusation
7975-280076-0004	june third eighteen seventy one oberkotter brothers bank at croyden iowa was robbed of forty thousand dollars by seven men in broad daylight

7975-280076-0006	the parts of this letter now relevant are as follows
7975-280076-0007	you may use this letter in your own way
7975-280076-0008	i will give you this outline and sketch of my whereabouts and actions at the time of certain robberies with which i am charged
7975-280076-0009	at the time of the galveston bank robbery i was gathering cattle in ellis county texas cattle that i bought from pleasants tailor and rector
7975-280076-0010	this can be proved by both of them also by sheriff barkley and fifty other respectable men of that county
7975-280076-0011	i brought the cattle to kansas city set fall and remained in saint clair county until february
7975-280076-0012	i then went to arkansas and returned to saint clair county about the first of may
7975-280076-0013	and went to kansas where our cattle were in woodson county at colonel ridges
7975-280076-0014	during the summer i was either in saint clair jackson or kansas but as there was no robbery committed that summer it makes no difference where i was
7975-280076-0015	i went there independence and from there to a's webb's
7975-280076-0016	there i took dinner and then went to doctor ellis wyman's
7975-280076-0017	our business there was to see e p w west he was not at home but the family will remember that we were there
7975-280076-0018	we crossed on the bridge stayed in the city all night and the next morning we rode up to the city
7975-280076-0019	i met several of my friends among them was bob hudspeth
7975-280076-0020	we were not on good terms at the time nor had we been for several years
7975-280076-0021	poor john he has been hunted down and shot like a wild beast and never was a boy more innocent
7975-280076-0022	doctor ellis was his physician
7975-280076-0023	there were fifty or a hundred persons there who will testify in any court that john and i were there
7975-280076-0024	helen fitchell and wife of green town valley were attending the springs at that time and either of them will testify to the above for john and i sat in front of mister smith while he was preaching and was in his company for a few moments together with his wife and mister and missus fitchell after the service
7975-280076-0025	about the last of december eighteen seventy three i arrived in carroll parish louisiana
7975-280076-0026	i stayed there until the eighth of february eighteen seventy four
7975-280076-0027	i had not heard of that when i wrote the letter of eighteen seventy four and to correct any misapprehension that might be created by omitting it i will say that at the time i was at niagara falls with a drove of cattle which i sold to major ray
7975-280076-0028	it was immediately following the rock island robbery at adair iowa that there first appeared a deliberate enlistment of some local papers in missouri to connect us with this robbery
7975-280063-0000	we took the oath perhaps three hundred of us down on luther mason's farm a few miles from where i now write where colonel hayes had encamped after independence
7975-280063-0001	boone and myself met coffee and the rest below roosevelt on grand river
7975-280063-0002	accordingly i was shortly awakened to accompany him to lone jack where he would personally make known the situation to the other colonels
7975-280063-0003	foster had nearly one thousand cavalrymen and two pieces of rab's battery that had already made for itself a name for hard fighting
7975-280063-0004	come in colonel hayes exclaimed colonel cockrell
7975-280063-0005	i think he'll be rather tough meat for breakfast i replied he might be all right for dinner
7975-280063-0006	jagman with a party of thirty seasoned men charged the indiana guns and captured them but major foster led a gallant charge against the invaders and recovered the pieces
7975-280063-0007	we were out of ammunition and were helpless had the fight been pressed
7975-280063-0008	they did mark my clothes in one or two places however
7975-280063-0009	major foster and a letter to judge george j emmons of minneapolis said
7975-280063-0010	i was told by some of our men from the western border of the state that they recognized the daring young rider as ko younger
7975-280063-0011	about nine thirty a m i was shot down
7975-280063-0012	the wounded of both forces were gathered up and were placed in houses
7975-280085-0000	that night it started to rain and we wore out our horses
7975-280085-0001	friday we moved toward waterville and friday night we camped between alesian and german lake
7975-280085-0002	bob shattered elbow was requiring frequent attention and that night we made only nine miles and monday monday night and tuesday we spent in a deserted farmhouse close to mancato
7975-280085-0003	that day a man named dunning discovered us and we took him prisoner
7975-280085-0004	finally we administered to him an oath not to betray our whereabouts until we had time to make our escape and he agreed not to
7975-280085-0005	no sooner however was he released than he made post haste into manceto to announce our presence and in a few minutes another posse was looking for us
7975-280085-0006	the whistle on the old mill blew and we feared that it was a signal that had been agreed upon to alarm the town in case we were observed but we were not molested
7975-280085-0007	he had to sleep with it pillow on my breast jim being also crippled with a wound in his shoulder and we could not get much sleep
7975-280085-0008	but they soon after got close enough so that one of them broke my walking stick with a shot
7975-280085-0009	we were in sight of our long sold horses when they cut us off from the animals and our last hope was gone
7975-280085-0010	six steps to the front sheriff glissman colonel t o vault b m rice g a bradford c a pomeroy and e j severance
7975-280085-0011	forming in line four paces apart he ordered them to advance rapidly and concentrate the fire of the whole line the instant the robbers were discovered
7975-280085-0012	make for the horses i said every man for himself
7975-280085-0013	there's no use stopping to pick up a comrade here for we can't get him through the line just charge them and make it if we can
7975-280085-0014	i got up as a signal for the charge and we fired one volley
7975-280085-0015	one of the fellows in the outer line not brave enough himself to join the volunteers who had come in to beat us out was not disposed to believe in the surrender and had his gun leveled on bob in spite of the handkerchief which was waving as a flag of truce
7975-280085-0016	sheriff glispin of watertown county who was taking bob's pistol from him was also shouting to the fellow
7975-280085-0017	including those received in and on the way from northfield i had eleven wounds
7975-280085-0018	in sheriff glispin's order not to shoot was the beginning of the protectorate that minnesota people established over us
7975-280084-0000	i urged on the boys that whatever happened we should not shoot anyone
7975-280084-0001	when miller and i crossed the bridge the three were on some dry goods boxes at the corner near the bank and as soon as they saw us went right into the bank instead of waiting for us to get there
7975-280084-0002	when we came up i told miller to shut the bank door which they had left open in their hurry
7975-280084-0003	j s allen whose hardware store was near tried to go into the bank but miller ordered him away and he ran around the corner shouting
7975-280084-0004	get your guns boys they're robbing the bank
7975-280084-0005	and i called to him to get inside at the same time firing a pistol shot in the air as a signal to the three boys at the bridge that we had been discovered
7975-280084-0006	almost at this instant i heard a pistol shot in the bank
7975-280084-0007	chadwell woods and jim rode up and joined us shouting to the people in the street to get inside and firing their pistols to emphasize their commands
7975-280084-0008	if any of our party shot him it must have been woods
7975-280084-0009	meantime the street was getting uncomfortably hot
7975-280084-0010	every time i saw anyone with a bead on me i would drop off my horse and try to drive the sheriff inside but i could not see in every direction
7975-280084-0011	doctor wheeler who had gone upstairs in the hotel shot miller and he lay dying in the street
7975-280084-0012	changing his pistol to his left hand bob ran out and mounted miller's mare
7975-280084-0013	what kept you so long i asked pete
7975-280084-0014	as to the rest of the affair inside the bank i take the account of a northfield narrator
7975-280084-0015	where's the money outside the safe bob asked
7975-280084-0016	the shutters were closed and this caused bucker an instant's delay that was almost fatal fitz chased him with a bullet
7975-280084-0017	the first one missed him but the second went through his right shoulder
3005-163389-0000	they swarmed up in front of sherburn's palings as thick as they could jam together and you couldn't hear yourself think for the noise
3005-163389-0001	some sung out tear down the fence tear down the fence
3005-163389-0002	the stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable
3005-163389-0003	sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out gaze em but they couldn't they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky
3005-163389-0004	the average man's a coward
3005-163389-0005	because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back in the dark and it's just what they would do
3005-163389-0006	so they always acquit and then a man goes in the night with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal
3005-163389-0007	you didn't want to come
3005-163389-0008	but a mob without any man at the head of it is beneath pitifulness
3005-163389-0009	now leave and take your half a man with you tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this
3005-163389-0010	the crowd washed back sudden and then broke all apart and went tearing off every which way and buck harkness he heeled it after them looking tolerable cheap
3005-163389-0011	you can't be too careful
3005-163389-0012	they argued and tried to keep him out but he wouldn't listen and the whole show come to a standstill
3005-163389-0013	and one or two women began to scream
3005-163389-0014	so then the ring master he made a little speech and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let em ride if he thought he could stay on the horse
3005-163389-0015	it warn't funny to me though i was all of a tremble to see his danger
3005-163389-0016	and a horse a going like a house afire too
3005-163389-0017	he shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air and altogether he shed seventeen suits
3005-163389-0018	why it was one of his own men
3005-163391-0000	which was sound enough judgment but you take the average man and he wouldn't wait for him to how
3005-163391-0001	the king's dude was all black and he did look real swell and starchy
3005-163391-0002	why before he looked like the orneryest old rip that ever was but now when he'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile he looked that grand and good and pious that you'd say he had walked right out of the ark and maybe was old leviticus himself
3005-163391-0003	jim cleaned up the canoe and i got my paddle ready
3005-163391-0004	where are you bound for young man
3005-163391-0005	get aboard says the king
3005-163391-0006	i done so and then we all three started on again
3005-163391-0007	the young chap was mighty thankful said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather
3005-163391-0008	he asked the king where he was going and the king told him he'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning and now he was going up a few miles to see an old friend on a farm up there the young fellow says
3005-163391-0009	but then i says again no i reckon it ain't him or else he wouldn't be paddlin up the river you ain't him are you
3005-163391-0010	no my name's blodgett alexander blodgett reverend alexander blodgett i suppose i must say as i'm one of the lord's poor servants
3005-163391-0011	you see he was pretty old and george's guyers was too young to be much company for him except mary jane the red headed one and so he was kinder lonesome after george and his wife died and didn't seem to care much to live
3005-163391-0012	too bad too bad he couldn't have lived to see his brother's poor soul
3005-163391-0013	i'm going in a ship next winter for rio janeiro where my uncle is
3005-163391-0014	but it'd be lovely wished i was a goin
3005-163391-0015	mary jane's nineteen susan's fifteen and joanna's about fourteen that's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hair lip poor things
3005-163391-0016	well they could be worse off
3005-163391-0017	old peter had friends and they ain't going to let them come to no harm
3005-163391-0018	blamed if he didn't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town and all about the wilkeses and about peter's business which was a tanner and about george's which was a carpenter and about harvey's which was a dissenting minister and so on and so on then he says
3005-163391-0019	when they're deep they won't stop for a hail
3005-163391-0020	was peter whilks well off
3005-163391-0021	when we struck the boat she was about done loading and pretty soon she got off
3005-163391-0022	now hustle back right off and fetch the duke up here and the new carpet bags
3005-163391-0023	so then they waited for a steamboat
3005-163391-0024	but the king was calm he says
3005-163391-0025	they give a glance at one another and nodded their heads as much as to say would de tell you
3005-163391-0026	then one of them says kind of soft and gentle
3005-163399-0000	phelpses was one of these little one horse cotton plantations and they all look alike
3005-163399-0001	i went around and climbed over the back stile by the ash hopper and started for the kitchen
3005-163399-0002	i out with a yes'm for i thought
3005-163399-0003	so then she started for the house leading me by the hand and the children tagging after
3005-163399-0004	when we got there she set me down in a split bottom chair and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me holding both of my hands and says
3005-163399-0005	well it's lucky because sometimes people do get hurt
3005-163399-0006	and i think he died afterwards he was a baptist
3005-163399-0007	yes it was mortification that was it
3005-163399-0008	your uncle's been up to the town every day to fetch you
3005-163399-0009	you must a met him on the road didn't you oldish man with a
3005-163399-0010	why child it'll be stole
3005-163399-0011	it was kinder thin ice but i says
3005-163399-0012	i had my mind on the children all the time i wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little and find out who i was
3005-163399-0013	pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back because she says
3005-163399-0014	i see it warn't a bit of use to try to go ahead i'd got to throw up my hand
3005-163399-0015	so i says to myself here's another place where i got to risk the truth
3005-163399-0016	i opened my mouth to begin but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed and says here he comes
3005-163399-0017	children don't you say a word
3005-163399-0018	i see i was in a fix now
3005-163399-0019	missus phelps she jumps for him and says
3005-163399-0020	has he come no says her husband
3005-163399-0021	i can't imagine says the old gentleman and i must say it makes me dreadful uneasy
3005-163399-0022	uneasy she says i'm ready to go distracted
3005-163399-0023	he must a come an you've missed him along the road
3005-163399-0024	oh don't distress me any more i'm already distressed
3005-163399-0025	why silas look yonder up the road ain't that somebody comin

3005-163399-0028	is tom sawyer
3005-163399-0029	being tom sawyer was easy and comfortable and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by i hear a steamboat chuffing along down the river
3005-163399-0030	then i says to myself spose tom sorey comes down on that boat
3005-163390-0000	and but never mind the rest of his outfit it was jest wild but it was awful funny
3005-163390-0001	the people most killed themselves laughing and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes they roared and clapped and stormed and howled till he come back and done it over again and after that they made him do it another time
3005-163390-0002	twenty people sings out
3005-163390-0003	the duke says yes
3005-163390-0004	everybody sings out sold
3005-163390-0005	but a big fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts hold on
3005-163390-0006	just a word gentlemen they stopped to listen
3005-163390-0007	what we want is to go out of here quiet and talk this show up and sell the rest of the town
3005-163390-0008	you bet it is the judge is right everybody sings out
3005-163390-0009	we struck the raft at the same time and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream all dark and still and edging towards the middle of the river nobody saying a word
3005-163390-0010	we never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village
3005-163390-0011	greenhorns flatheads

3005-163390-0025	when i waked up jest at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees moaning and mourning to himself
3005-163390-0026	it don't seem natural but i reckon it's so
3005-163390-0027	he was often moaning and mourning that way nights when he judged i was asleep and saying po little lisbeth

6938-70848-0009	we know what the peasants will say aren't they working men like ourselves
6938-70848-0010	this man especially welcomed the call to a congress of peasants
6938-70848-0011	this last was the young generation who had been serving in the army
6938-70848-0012	whereupon the old executed committee left the hall
6938-70848-0013	down with him they shrieked
6938-70848-0014	fearful templar cries down with the balshevik
6938-70848-0015	upon my return i visited mollie no such accusation was made against me there after a brief conversation i left and that's all let anyone present make such an accusation
6938-70848-0016	meanwhile the question of the statutes of the executed committee was agitating all minds
6938-70848-0017	by declaring the assembly extraordinary conference it had been planned to plug the re election of the executive committee
6938-70848-0018	but this worked both ways the left socialist decided that if the congress had no power over the executive committee then the executive committee had no power over the congress
6938-70848-0019	on the twenty seventh occurred the debate on the land question which revealed the differences between the agrarian program of the bolshevik and the left socialist revolutionaries
6938-70848-0020	the constituent assembly will not dare to break with the will of the people
6938-70848-0021	followed him lenin listened to now with absorbing intensity
6938-70848-0022	the first stage was the crushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of the industrial capitalist and the landowners whose interests are closely related
6938-70848-0023	the dumas and zhemstovs were dropped
6938-70848-0024	he knew that an agreement with the bolcheviki was being discussed but he did not know that it had been concluded
6938-70848-0025	he spoke to the rum convention
6938-70848-0026	the villagers will save us in the end
6938-70848-0027	but the present moment is international and that is why it is invincible
6938-70848-0028	the wheel of millions of workers is now concentrated in the hall
6938-70848-0029	a new humanity will be born of this war
6938-70848-0030	i greet you with the christening of a new russian life and freedom
8131-117029-0000	there was a man coming from earth on a second ship who would see him
8131-117029-0001	the little publisher was back at the crusader again
8131-117029-0002	only gordon and sheila were left
8131-117029-0003	credit had been established again and the businesses were open
8131-117029-0004	gordon came to a row of temporary bubbles individual dwellings built like the dome but opaque for privacy
8131-117029-0005	they had been lucky
8131-117029-0006	schulberg's volunteers were official now
8131-117029-0007	fat's place was still open though the crooked tables had been removed gordon dropped to a stool slipping off his helmet
8131-117029-0008	he reached automatically for the glass of etherneededled beer
8131-117029-0009	thought you'd be in the chips
8131-117029-0010	that's mars gordon echoed the other's comment why don't you pull off the planet fats you could go back to earth i'd guess the other nodded
8131-117029-0011	guess a man gets used to anything hell maybe i can hire some bums to sit around and whoop it up when the ships come in and bill this is a real old martian den of sin
8131-117029-0012	there was a grin on the other's face
8131-117029-0013	finally got our orders for you it's murder
8131-117029-0014	we sent twenty others the same way and they failed
8131-117029-0015	let's say you've shifted some of the misery around a bit and given them a chance to do better
8131-117029-0016	you can't stay here
8131-117029-0017	there's a rocket waiting to transship you to the moon on the way to mercury right now gordon sighed
8131-117029-0018	and i paid her the pay we owe you from the time you began using your badge she's out shopping
8131-117029-0019	but his old eyes were glinting
8131-117029-0020	did you think we'd let you go without seeing you off cobber he asked
8131-117029-0021	i i oh dread it i'm getting old ezzy you tell him
8131-117029-0022	he grabbed gordon's hand and waddled down the landing plank izzie shook his head
8131-117017-0000	it was night outside and the phosphorescent balloons at the corners glowed dimly giving him barely enough light by which to locate the way to the extemporized precinct house
8131-117017-0001	it had probably been years since enny had dared risk it after the sun went down
8131-117017-0002	and the slow doubtful respect on the faces of the citizens as they nodded to him was even more proof that haley's system was working
8131-117017-0003	gordon hit the signal switch and the marespeaker let out a shrill whistle
8131-117017-0004	guns suddenly seemed to be flourishing everywhere
8131-117017-0005	you can't do it to me
8131-117017-0006	i'm reformed i'm going straight
8131-117017-0007	you damned cops can't onia was blubbering
8131-117017-0008	one look was enough the work papers had the tell tale over thickening of the signature they had shown up on other papers obviously forgeries
8131-117017-0009	some turned away as gordon and the other cop went to work but most of them weren't squeamish
8131-117017-0010	when it was over the two picked up their whimpering captive
8131-117017-0011	jennings the other cop had been holding the wallet
8131-117017-0012	must have been making a big contact in something fifty fifty
8131-117017-0013	there must have been over two thousand credits in the wallet
8131-117017-0014	when gordon and jenkins came back murdock tossed the money to them split it
8131-117017-0015	whatever comes to hand governor
8131-117017-0016	like this social call gordon asked him
8131-117017-0017	the little man shook his head his ancient eighteen year old face turning sober nope
8131-117017-0018	you owe me some bills governor
8131-117017-0019	eleven hundred fifty credits
8131-117017-0020	you didn't pay up your pledge to the captain fund so i had to fill in
8131-117017-0021	a thousand interest at ten per cent a week standard rate
8131-117017-0022	gordon had heard of the friendly interest charged on the side here but he shook his head wrong is he
8131-117017-0023	ha ez he turned it over and shook his head
8131-117017-0024	now show me where i signed any agreement saying i'd pay you back
8131-117017-0025	for a second izzie's face went blank then he chuckled
8131-117017-0026	he pulled out the bills and handed them over
8131-117017-0027	thanks izzy thanks yourself
8131-117017-0028	the kid pocketed the money cheerfully nodding
8131-117017-0029	the little guy knew mars as few others did apparently from all sides
8131-117017-0030	and if any of the other cops had private rackets of their own izzy was undoubtedly the man to find it out and use the information with a beat such as that even going halves and with all the graft to the upper brackets he'd still be able to make his pile in a matter of months
8131-117017-0031	the captain looked completely beaten as he came into the room and dropped onto the bench
8131-117017-0032	go on except dammit
8131-117016-0000	captain murdoch
8131-117016-0001	but maresport had flourished enough to kill it off
8131-117016-0002	some of mars laws dated from the time when law enforcement had been hampered by lack of men rather than by the type of men
8131-117016-0003	the stonewall gang numbered perhaps five hundred
8131-117016-0004	even derelicts and failures had to eat there were stores and shops throughout the district which eked out some kind of a marginal living
8131-117016-0005	they were safe from protection racketeers there none bothered to come so far out
8131-117016-0006	the shopkeepers and some of the less unfortunate people there had protested loud enough to reach clear back to earth
8131-117016-0007	captain murdoch was an unknown factor and now was asking for more men
8131-117016-0008	the pressure was enough to get them for him
8131-117016-0009	gordon reported for work with a sense of the bottom falling out mixed with a vague relief
8131-117016-0010	i've got a free hand and we're going to run this the way we would on earth
8131-117016-0011	your job is to protect the citizens here and that means everyone not breaking the laws whether you feel like it or not no graph
8131-117016-0012	the first man making a shake down will get the same treatment we're going to use on the stone wall boys you'll get double pay here and you can live on it
8131-117016-0013	he picked out five of the men including gordon you five will come with me
8131-117016-0014	the rest of you can team up any way you want to night pick any route that's open okay men let's go
8131-117016-0015	bruce gordon grinned slowly as he swung the stick and murdoch's eyes fell on him earth cop
8131-117016-0016	two years gordon admitted
8131-117016-0017	for a second gordon cursed himself
8131-117016-0018	he began wondering about security then
8131-117016-0019	nobody had tried to get in touch with him
8131-117016-0020	there was a crude lighting system here put up by the citizens at the front of each building a dim phosphorescent balloon glowed when darkness fell they would have nothing else to see by
8131-117016-0021	moving in two groups of threes at opposite sides of the street they began their beat
8131-117016-0022	there was no chance to save the citizen who was dying from lack of air
8131-117016-0023	gordon felt the solid pleasure of the finely turned club in his hands
8131-117016-0024	gordon's eyes popped at that
8131-117016-0025	he swallowed the sentiment his own club was moving now
8131-117016-0026	the other four cops had come in reluctantly
8131-117016-0027	he brought him to the ground with a single blow across the kidneys
8131-117016-0028	they rounded up the men of the gang and one of the cops started off
8131-117016-0029	to find a phone and call the wagon
8131-117016-0030	we're not using wagons murdoch told him line them up
8131-117016-0031	if they tried to run they were hit from behind if they stood still they were clubbed carefully
8131-117016-0032	murdoch indicated one who stood with his shoulders shaking and tears running down his cheeks
8131-117016-0033	the captain's face was as sick as gordon's felt
8131-117016-0034	i want the name of every man in the gang you can remember he told the man
8131-117016-0035	colonel they'd kill me i don't know
8131-117016-0036	murdoch took his nod as evidence enough and turned to the wretched tuffs
8131-117016-0037	if he should turn up dead i'll know you boys are responsible and i'll find you
8131-117016-0038	trouble began brewing shortly after though
8131-117016-0039	murdock sent one of the men to pick up a second squad of six and then a third
8131-117016-0040	in the third one bruce gordon spotted one of the men who had been beaten before
8131-117016-0041	get a stretcher and take him wherever he belongs he ordered
8131-117016-0042	but the captain stirred finally sighing
8131-117016-0043	no the cops they're giving me we covered gordon
8131-117016-0044	but the stonewall gang is backing wain
8131-117016-0045	but it's going to be tough on them
8131-117016-0046	bruce gordon grimmed i've got a yellow ticket from security
8131-117016-0047	murdock blinked he dropped his eyes slowly
8131-117016-0048	what makes you think wain will be reelected
8131-117016-0049	nobody wants him except a gang of crooks and those in power
8131-117016-0050	ever see a martian election
8131-117016-0051	no you're a first rate he can't lose
8131-117016-0052	and then hell is going to pop and this whole planet may be blown wide open
8131-117016-0053	it fitted with the dire predictions of security and with the spying gordon was going to do according to them
8131-117016-0054	he was getting even fatter now that he was eating better food from the fair restaurant around the corner
8131-117016-0055	cost 'em more but they'd be respectable
8131-117016-0056	because izzy is always honest according to how he sees it
8131-117016-0057	but you got earth ideas of the stuff like i had once
8131-117016-0058	the groups grew more experienced and murdoc was training a new squad every night
8131-117016-0059	it wasn't exactly legal but nothing was here
8131-117016-0060	this could lead to abuses as he'd seen on earth
8131-117016-0061	but there probably wouldn't be time for it if mayor wayne was reelected
5442-32873-0000	captain lake did not look at all like a london dandy now
5442-32873-0001	there was a very natural savagery and dejection there and a wild leer in his yellow eyes rachel sat down
5442-32873-0002	a slave only think a slave
5442-32873-0003	oh frightful frightful is it a dream
5442-32873-0004	oh frightful frightful
5442-32873-0005	stanley stanley it would be mercy to kill me she broke her again
5442-32873-0006	bright and natty with chintz curtains and the little toilet set out not inelegantly and her pet piping goldfinch asleep on his perch with its bit of sugar between the wires of his cage her pillow so white and unpressed with its little edging of lace
5442-32873-0007	when he came back to the drawing room a toilet bottle of eau de cologne in his hand with her lace handkerchief he bathed her temples and forehead
5442-32873-0008	there was nothing very brotherly in his look as he peered into her pale sharp features during the process
5442-32873-0009	there don't mind me she said sharply and getting up she looked down at her dress and thin shoes and seeming to recollect herself she took the candle he had just set down and went swiftly to her room
5442-32873-0010	and she threw back her veil and going hurriedly to the toilet mechanically surveyed herself in the glass
5442-32873-0011	rachel leach rachel leach what are you now
5442-32873-0012	i'll stay here that is in the drawing room she answered and the face was withdrawn
5442-32873-0013	he slackened his pace and tapped sharply at the little window of that modest post office at which the young ladies in the pony carriage had pulled up the day before and within which luke waggett was wont to sleep in a sort of wooden box that folded up and appeared to be a chest of drawers all day
5442-32873-0014	luke took care of mister larkin's dog and groomed mister wilder's horse and cleaned up his dog cart for mark being close about money and finding that the thing was to be done more cheaply that way put up his horse and dog cart in the post office premises and so evaded the livery charges of the brandon arms
5442-32873-0015	but luke was not there and captain lake recollecting his habits and his haunt hurried on to the silver line which has its gable towards the common only about a hundred steps away for distances are not great in jerlington
5442-32873-0016	here where the flow of soul and of stout long pipes long yarns and tolerably long credits and the humble skep graces of the town resorted thither for the pleasures of a club life and often revelled deep into the small hours of the morning
5442-32873-0017	lose no time and i'll give you half a crown
5442-32873-0018	luke stuck on his greasy wide awake and in a few minutes more the dog cart was trundled out into the lane and the horse harnessed went between the shafts with that wonderful cheerfulness with which they bear to be called up under startling circumstances at unseasonable hours
5442-32873-0019	if i thought you'd fail me now to mar i should never come back good night to mar
5442-41168-0000	the act said that in case of difference of opinion there must be a ballot
5442-41168-0001	he went up to the table and striking it with his finger ring he shouted loudly a ballot
5442-41168-0002	he was shouting for the very coarse sir george ivanovitch had proposed but it was evident that he hated him and all his party and this feeling of hatred spread through the whole party and roused in opposition to it the same vindictiveness though in a more seemly form on the other side
5442-41168-0003	shouts were raised and for a moment all was confusion so that the marshal of the province had to call for order a ballet
5442-41168-0004	we shed our blood for our country
5442-41168-0005	the confidence of the monarch no checking the accounts of the marshal he's not a cashier but that's not the point
5442-41168-0006	votes please piece
5442-41168-0007	they expressed the most implacable hatred
5442-41168-0008	levan did not in the least understand what was the matter and he marvelled at the passion with which it was disputed whether or not the decision about fleuravon should be put to the vote
5442-41168-0009	he forgot as sergei ivanovitch explained to him afterwards this sergeism that it was necessary for the public good to get rid of the marshal of the province that to get rid of the marshal it was necessary to have a majority of votes that to secure the recognition of flore's right to vote they must decide on the interpellation to be put on the act
5442-41168-0010	but levin forgot all that and it was painful to him to see all these excellent persons for whom he had a respect in such an unpleasant and vicious state of excitement
5442-41168-0011	to escape from this painful feeling he went away into the other room where there was nobody except the waiters at the freshman bar
5442-41168-0012	he particularly liked the way one gray whiskered waiter who showed a scorn for the other younger ones and was jured at by them was teaching them how to fold up napkins properly
5442-41168-0013	levin advanced but utterly forgetting what he was to do and much embarrassed he turned to sergei ivanovitch with the question where am i to put it
5442-41168-0014	serge ivanovitch frowned
5442-41168-0015	that is a matter for each man's own decision he said severely
5442-41168-0016	having put it in he recollected that he ought to have thrust his left hand too and so he thrust it in though too late and still more overcome with confusion he beat a hasty retreat into the background
5442-41168-0017	a hundred and twenty six for admission ninety eight against
5442-41168-0018	sang out the voice of the secretary who could not pronounce the letter a
5442-41168-0019	then there was a laugh a button and two nuts were found in the box
5442-41168-0020	but the old party did not consider themselves conquered
5442-41168-0021	in reply snetkov spoke of the trust the nobleman of the province had placed in him the affection they had shown him which he did not deserve as his only merit had been his attachment to the nobility to whom he had devoted twelve years of service
5442-41168-0022	this expression in the marshal's face was particularly touching to levin because only the day before he had been at his house about his trusty business and had seen him in all his grandeur a kind hearted fatherly man
5442-41168-0023	if there are men younger and more deserving than i let them serve
5442-41168-0024	and the marshal disappeared through a side door
5442-41168-0025	they were to proceed immediately to the election
5442-41168-0026	two noble gentlemen who had a weakness for strong drink had been made drunk by the partisans of snetkov and a third had been robbed of his uniform
5442-41168-0027	on learning this the new party had made haste during the dispute about flershov to send some of their men in a sledge to clothe the stripped gentlemen and to bring along one of the intoxicated to the meeting
5442-41169-0000	levin did not care to eat and he was not smoking he did not want to join his own friends that is sergey ivanovitch stepan arkadyevitch sviersky and the rest because vronsky in his equerry's uniform was standing with them in eager conversation
5442-41169-0001	he went to the window and sat down scanning the groups and listening to what was being said around him
5442-41169-0002	he's such a blackguard
5442-41169-0003	i have told him so but it makes no difference only think of it
5442-41169-0004	these persons were unmistakably seeking a place where they could talk without being overheard
5442-41169-0005	shall we go on your excellency fine champagne
5442-41169-0006	last year at our district marshal nicola ivanovitch's
5442-41169-0007	oh still just the same always at a loss the landowner answered with a resigned smile but with an expression of serenity and conviction that so it must be
5442-41169-0008	why what is there to understand
5442-41169-0009	there is no meaning in it at all
5442-41169-0010	then too one must keep up connections
5442-41169-0011	it's a moral obligation of a sort
5442-41169-0012	and then to tell the truth this is one's own interests
5442-41169-0013	they are proprietors of a sort but we are the landowners
5442-41169-0014	that it may be but still it ought to be treated a little more respectfully
5442-41169-0015	if we are laying out a garden planning one before the house you know and there you have a tree that stood over centuries in the very spot old and gnarled it may be and yet you don't cut down the old fellow to make room for the flower beds but lay out your beds so as to take advantage of the tree
5442-41169-0016	well and how is your land doing
5442-41169-0017	but one's work is thrown in for nothing
5442-41169-0018	oh well one does it what would you have
5442-41169-0019	and what's more the landowner went on leaning his elbows on the window and chatting on my son i must tell you has no taste for it
5442-41169-0020	so there'll be no one to keep it up and yet one does it
5442-41169-0021	we walked about the fields and the garden no said he stepan volkovitch everything's well looked after but your garden's neglected
5442-41169-0022	to my thinking i'd cut down the lime tree
5442-41169-0023	here you have thousands of limes and each would make two good bundles of bark
5442-41169-0024	your married i heard said the land owner
5442-41169-0025	yes it's rather strange he went on
5442-41169-0026	the landowner chuckled under his white mustaches
5442-41169-0027	why don't we cut down our parks for timber
5442-41169-0028	said levin returning to a thought that had struck him
5442-41169-0029	there's a class instinct too of what one ought and ought not to do
5442-41169-0030	there's the peasants too i wonder at them sometimes any good peasant tries to take all the land he can
5442-41169-0031	without a return too ad a simple loss
367-293981-0000	i swear it answered montez
367-293981-0001	i say so continued don quixote because i hate taking away anyone's good name
367-293981-0002	i say replied sancho that i swear to hold my tongue about it till the end of your worship's days and god grant i may be able to let it out tomorrow
367-293981-0003	though your worship was not so badly off having in your arms the incomparable beauty you spoke of but i what did i have except the heaviest wax that i think i had in all my life
367-293981-0004	unlucky me and the mother that bore me
367-293981-0005	didn't i say so worse luck to my line said sancho
367-293981-0006	it cannot be the more answered don quixote for those under enchantment do not let themselves be seen by anyone
367-293981-0007	if they do not let themselves be seen they let themselves be felt said sancho if not let my shoulders speak to the point
367-293981-0008	mine could speak too said don quixote but that is not a sufficient reason for believing that what we see is the enchanted moor
367-293981-0009	the officers turned to him and said well how goes it good man
367-293981-0010	senor got up with pain enough in his bones and went after the innkeeper in the dark and meeting the officer who was looking to see what had become of his enemy he said to him senor whoever you are do us the favor and kindness to give us a little rosemary oil salt and wine for it is wanted to keep one of our best knights errant on earth who lies on yonder bed wounded by the hands of the enchanted moor that is in this inn
367-293981-0011	to be brief he took the materials of which he made a compound mixing them on and boiling them a good while until it seemed to him they had come to perfection
367-293981-0012	sancho panza who also regarded the amendment of his master as miraculous begged him to give him what was left in the pike skin which was no small quantity
367-293981-0013	don quixote consented and he taking it with both hands in good faith and with a better will knelt down and drained off very little less than his master
367-293981-0014	if your worship knew that returned sancho well be tided me and all my kindred why did you let me taste it
367-293981-0015	search your memory and if you find anything of this kind you need only tell me of it and i promise you by the order of knighthood which i have received to procure you satisfaction and a reparation to the utmost of your desire
367-293981-0016	then this isn't an inn said don quixote
367-293981-0017	and a very respectable one said the innkeeper
367-293981-0018	the cries of the poor blanketed wretch were so loud that they reached the ears of his master who halting to listen attentively was persuaded that some new adventure was coming until he clearly perceived that it was his squire who uttered them
367-293981-0019	he saw him rising and falling in the air with such grace and nimbleness that had his rage allowed him it is my belief he would have laughed
367-293981-0020	sancho took it and as he was raising it to his mouth he was stopped by the cries of his master exclaiming sancho my son drink not water drink it not my son for it will kill thee see here i have the blessed balm and he held up the flask of liquor and with drinking two drops of it thou would certainly be restored
367-130732-0000	lobsters and lobsters
367-130732-0001	when is a lobster not a lobster when it is a crayfish
367-130732-0002	this question and answer might well go into the primary information for those who come to san francisco from the east for what is called a lobster in san francisco is not a lobster at all but a crayfish
367-130732-0003	the pacific crayfish however serves every purpose and while many contend that its meat is not so delicate and flavorful as that of its eastern cousin the californian will as strenuously insist that it is better but of course something must always be allowed for the patriotism of the californians

3538-163619-0000	there was once a time a widower who had a son and a daughter by his first wife
3538-163619-0001	from the very day that the new wife came into the house there was no peace for the man's children and not a corner to be found where they could get any rest so the boy thought that the best thing he could do was to go out into the world and try to earn his own bread
3538-163619-0002	but his sister who was still at home fared worse and worse
3538-163619-0003	tiss me girl said the head
3538-163619-0004	and when the king entered and saw he stood still as if he were in fetters and could not stir from the spot for the picture seemed to him so beautiful
3538-163619-0005	the youth promised to make all the haste he could and set forth from the king's palace
3538-163619-0006	at last they came in sight of land
3538-163619-0007	well if my brother says so i must do it said the man's daughter and she flung her casket into the sea
3538-163619-0008	and what is my brother saying asked his sister again
3538-163619-0009	on the first thursday night after this a beautiful maiden came into the kitchen of the palace and begged the kitchen maid who slept there to lend her a brush
3538-163619-0010	she begged very prettily and got it and then she brushed her hair and the gold dropped from it
3538-163619-0011	out on thee ugly bushy bride sleeping so soft by the young king's side on sand and stones my bed i make and my brother sleeps with the cold snake unpity'd and unwept
3538-163619-0012	i shall come twice more and then never again said she
3538-163619-0013	this time also as before she borrowed a brush and brushed her hair with it and the gold dropped down as she did it and again she sent the dog out three times and when day dawned she departed but as she was going she said as she had said before i shall come once more and then never again
3538-163619-0014	no one can tell how delighted the king was to get rid of that hideous bushy bride and get a queen who was bright and beautiful as day itself
3538-163622-0000	wilt thou serve me and watch my seven folds asked the king
3538-163622-0001	the youth thought that it was very easy work to wash the floors and he could do it well enough
3538-163622-0002	hast thou watched faithfully and well the whole day long said the king when the lad came into his presence in the evening
3538-163622-0003	yes that i have said the youth
3538-163622-0004	he had gone out once to seek a place he said but never would he do such a thing again
3538-163622-0005	then the king promised him the same punishment and the same reward that he had promised his brother
3538-163622-0006	when he had run after the foals for a long long time and was hot and tired he passed by a cleft in the rock where an old woman was sitting spinning with a distaff and she called to him
3538-163622-0007	come hither come hither my handsome son and let me comb your hair
3538-163622-0008	the youth liked the thought of this let the fulls run where they chose and seated himself in the cleft of the rock by the side of the old hag
3538-163622-0009	so there he sat with his head on her lap taking his ease the live long day
3538-163622-0010	on the third day syderland wanted to set out
3538-163622-0011	the two brothers laughed at him and his father and mother begged him not to go but all to no purpose and sinbad set out on his way
3538-163622-0012	i am walking about in search of a place said senderelad
3538-163622-0013	i would much rather have the princess said cinderella
3538-163622-0014	and thus they journeyed onwards a long long way
3538-163622-0015	when they had gone thus for a long long way the fool again asked dost thou see anything now
3538-163622-0016	yes now i see something that is white said cinderella lad
3538-163622-0017	it looks like the chunk of a great thick birch tree
3538-163622-0018	cynderella tried but could not do it so he had to take a draught from the pitcher and then one more and after that still another and then he was able to wheel the sword with perfect ease
3538-163622-0019	for we are brothers of the princess whom thou art to have when thou canst tell the king what we eat and drink but there is a mighty troll who has cast a spell over us
3538-163622-0020	when they had travelled a long long way the foal said dost thou see anything
3538-163622-0021	and now inquired the fool see'st thou nothing now
3538-163622-0022	now then said the fool dost thou not see anything now
3538-163622-0023	that is a river said the fool and we have to cross it
3538-163622-0024	i have done my best replied cinderella
3538-163624-0000	once upon a time there was a king in the north who had won many wars but now he was old
3538-163624-0001	the old king went out and fought bravely but at last his sword broke and he was wounded and his men fled
3538-163624-0002	but in the night when the battle was over his young wife came out and searched for him among the slain and at last she found him and asked whether he might be healed
3538-163624-0003	so you ask the queen how do you know in the dark of night whether the hours are wearing to the morning and she said
3538-163624-0004	then the old man said drive all the horses into the river and choose the one that swims across
3538-163624-0005	he is no bigger than other dragons said the tutor and if you were as brave as your father you would not fear him
3538-163624-0006	then the person who had killed otter went down and caught the dwarf who owned all the treasure and took it from him
3538-163624-0007	only one ring was left which the dwarf wore and even that was taken from him
3538-163624-0008	so reagan made a sword and sigurd tried it with a blow on a lump of iron and the sword broke
3538-163624-0009	then sigurd went to his mother and asked for the broken pieces of his father's blade and gave them to regan
3538-163624-0010	so sigurd said that sword would do
3538-163624-0011	then he saw the track which the dragon had made when he went to a cliff to drink and the track was as if a great river had rolled along and left a deep valley
3538-163624-0012	but sigurd waited till half of him had crawled over the pit and then he thrust the sword graham right into his very heart
3538-163624-0013	sigurd said i would touch none of it if by losing it i should never die
3538-163624-0014	but all men die and no brave man lets death frighten him from his desire
3538-163624-0015	die thou fafter and then fafter died
3538-163624-0016	then sigurd rode back and met reagan and reagan asked him to roast fafter's heart and let him taste of it
3538-163624-0017	so siger put the heart of fafner on a stake and roasted it
3538-163624-0018	there is sigurd rosting fafter's heart for another when he should taste of it himself and learn all wisdom
3538-163624-0019	that let him do then ride over hinfield to the place where brunhild sleeps
3538-163624-0020	there must she sleep till thou comes for her waking rise up and ride for now sure she will swear the vow fearless of breaking
3538-163624-0021	then he took the helmet off the head of the sleeper and behold she was a most beautiful lady
3538-163624-0022	then sigurd rode away and he came to the house of a king who had a fair daughter
3538-163624-0023	win brownhill's father told gunter that she would marry none but him who could ride the flame in front of her enchanted tower and thither they rode and gunter set his horse at the flame but he would not face it
3538-163624-0024	for one day when bernhard and gwendolen were bathing bernhard waited farthest out into the river and said she did that to show she was gwendolen's superior
3538-163624-0025	for her husband she said had ridden through the flame when no other man dared face it
3538-163624-0026	not long to wait he said till the bitter sword stands fast in my heart and thou wilt not live long when i am dead
3538-142836-0000	general observations on preserves confectionery ices and dessert dishes
3538-142836-0001	the expense of preserving them with sugar is a serious objection for except the sugar is used in considerable quantities the success is very uncertain
3538-142836-0002	fruit gathered in wet or foggy weather will soon be mildewed and be of no service for preserves
3538-142836-0003	but to distinguish these properly requires very great attention and considerable experience
3538-142836-0004	if you dip the finger into the serum and apply to the thumb the tenacity of the serum will on separating the finger and thumb afford a thread which shortly breaks this is the little thread
3538-142836-0005	let it boil up again then take it off and remove carefully the scum that has risen
3538-142836-0006	it is considered to be sufficiently boiled when some taken up in a spoon pours out like oil
3538-142836-0007	before sugar was in use honey was employed to preserve many vegetable productions though this substance has now given way to the juice of the sugar cane
3538-142836-0008	fourteen ninety nine
3538-142836-0009	boil them up three days successively skimming each time and they will then be finished and in a state fit to be put into pots for use
3538-142836-0010	the reason why the fruit is emptied out of the preserving pan into an earthen pan is that the acid of the fruit acts upon the copper of which the preserving pans are usually made
3538-142836-0011	from this example the process of preserving fruits by syrup would be easily comprehended
3538-142836-0012	they should be dried in the stove or oven on a sieve and turned every six or eight hours fresh powdered sugar being sifted over them every time they are turned
3538-142836-0013	in this way it is also that orange and lemonchips are preserved
3538-142836-0014	marmalades jams and fruit pastes are of the same nature and are now in very general request
3538-142836-0015	marmolades and jams differ little from each other there preserves of half liquid consistency made by boiling the pulp of fruits and sometimes part of the rinds with sugar
3538-142836-0016	that they may keep it as necessary not to be sparing of sugar fifteen o three
3538-142836-0017	in all the operations for preserve making when the preserve pan is used it should not be placed on the fire but on a rivet unless the jam is made on a hot plate when this is not necessary
3538-142836-0018	confectionery fifteen o eight
3538-142836-0019	in speaking of confectionery it should be remarked that all the various preparations above named come strictly speaking under pharmacy as well as for sweetmeats were called confections from the latin word confectio to make up but the term confectionery embraces a very large class indeed of sweet food many kinds of which should not be attempted in the ordinary cuisine
3538-142836-0020	the thousand and one ornamental dishes that adorn the tables of the wealthy should be purchased from the confectioner and they cannot profitable be made at home
3538-142836-0021	however as late as the reign of our two last georges fabulous sums were often expended upon fanciful diversions
3538-142836-0022	the shape of the dishes varies at different periods the prevailing fashion at present being oval and circular dishes on stems
3538-142836-0023	ices
3538-142836-0024	at desserts or at some evening parties ices are scarcely to be dispensed with
3538-142836-0025	the spaddle is generally made of copper kept bright and clean
3538-142836-0026	they should be taken immediately after the repast or some hours after because the taking of these substances during the process of digestion is apt to provoke indigestion
8461-281231-0000	his followers rushed forward to where he lay and their united force compelling the black knight to pause they dragged the wounded leader within the walls
8461-281231-0001	it was on their journey to that town that they were overtaken on the road by sedric and his party in whose company they were afterwards carried captive to the castle of torquilstone
8461-281231-0002	as he lay upon his bed racked with pain and mental agony and filled with the fear of rapidly approaching death he heard a voice address him
8461-281231-0003	what art thou he exclaimed in terror
8461-281231-0004	leave me and seek the saxon wench ulrica who was my temptress let her as well as i taste the tortures which anticipate hell
8461-281231-0005	exclaimed the norman oh
8461-281231-0006	rememberest thou the magazine of fuel that is stored beneath these apartments woman
8461-281231-0007	they are fast rising at least said erika and a signal shall soon wave to warn the besiegers to press hard upon those who would extinguish them
8461-281231-0008	meanwhile the black knight had led his forces again to the attack and so vigorous was their assault that before long the gate of the castle alone separated them from those within
8461-281231-0009	the defendants finding the castle to be on fire now determined to sell their lives as dearly as they could and headed by the bracey they threw open the gate and were at once involved in a terrific conflict with those outside
8461-281231-0010	the black knight with portentous strength forced his way inward in spite of the de bracy and his followers
8461-281231-0011	two of the foremost instantly fell and the rest gave way notwithstanding all the leader's efforts to stop them
8461-281231-0012	the black knight was soon engaged in desperate combat with the norman chief and the vaulted roof of the hall rang with furious blows
8461-281231-0013	at length debracy fell
8461-281231-0014	tell me thy name or work thy pleasure on me
8461-281231-0015	yet first let me say said debracy what it imports thee to know
8461-281231-0016	exclaimed the black knight prisoner and perish
8461-281231-0017	the life of every man in the castle shall answer it if a hair of his head be singed show me his chamber
8461-281231-0018	raising the wounded man with ease the black knight rushed with him to the postern gate and having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen he again entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners
8461-281231-0019	but in other parts the besiegers pursued the defenders of the castle from chamber to chamber and satiated in their blood the vengeance which had long enanimated them against the soldiers of the tyrant from the beuf
8461-281231-0020	as the fire commenced to spread rapidly through all parts of the castle oureka appeared on one of the turrets
8461-281231-0021	before long the towering flames had surmounted every obstruction and rose through the evening skies one huge and burning beacon seen far and wide through the adjacent country tower after tower crashed down with blazing roof and rafter
8461-281231-0022	at length with a terrific crash the whole tower gave way and she perished in the flames which had consumed her tyrant
8461-281231-0023	when the outlaws had divided the spoils which they had taken from the castle of talke stone sedric prepared to take his departure
8461-281231-0024	he left the gallant band of forester's sorrowing deeply for his lost friend the lord of coningsburgh and he and his followers had scarce departed when a procession moved slowly from under the greenwood branches in the direction which he had taken in the centre of which was the car in which the body of adelstane was laid
8461-281231-0025	debrecy bowed low and in silence threw himself upon a horse and galloped off through the wood
8461-281231-0026	here is a bugle which an english yeoman has once worn i pray you to keep it as a memorial of your gallant bearing
8461-281231-0027	so saying he mounted his strong war horse and rode off through the forest
8461-281231-0028	during all this time isaac of york sat mournfully apart grieving for the loss of his dearly loved daughter rebecca
8461-281231-0029	and with this epistle then happy old man set out to procure his daughter's liberation
8461-281231-0030	the tempter is led said the bracy in answer to the prince's eager questions from the beau you will never see more and he added in a low and emphatic tone richard is in england i have seen him and spoken with him
8461-281231-0031	he appealed to the bracey to assist him in this project and became at once deeply suspicious of the knight's loyalty towards him when he declined to lift hand against the man who had spared his own life
8461-281231-0032	before reaching his destination he was told that lucas de bourmont the grand master of the order of the templars was then on visit to the preceptor
8461-281231-0033	he had not until then been informed of the presence of the jewish maiden in the abode of the templars and great was his fury and indignation on learning that she was amongst them
8461-281231-0034	poor isaac was hurried off accordingly and expelled from the presbytery all his entreaties and even his offers unheard and disregarded
8461-281231-0035	the assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave her courage to look around and to mark into whose presence she had been conducted
8461-281231-0036	she gazed accordingly upon a scene which might well have struck terror into a bolder heart than hers
8461-281231-0037	at his feet was placed a table occupied by two scribes whose duty it was to record the proceedings of the day
8461-281231-0038	the preceptors of whom there were four present occupied seats behind the superiors and behind them stood the esquires of the order robed in white
8461-278226-0000	and lora had her own pet plans
8461-278226-0001	she meant to be scrupulously conscientious in the administration of a talent and sometimes at church on a sunday when the sermon was particularly awakening she mentally debated a serious question as to whether the new bonnets and gloves were on the whole a patentable weakness as being good for trade
8461-278226-0002	one morning laura told her husband with a gay laugh that she was going to victimize him but he was to promise to be patient and bear with her for once in a way
8461-278226-0003	i want to see all the pictures the modern pictures especially
8461-278226-0004	i remember all the ruby says at the louvre for i saw them three years ago when i was staying in paris with grandpapa
8461-278226-0005	she returned in a little more than ten minutes in the freshest twilight all pale shimmering blue like the spring sky with pear grey gloves and boots and parasol and a bonnet that seemed made of ashes butterflies
8461-278226-0006	he was drawing towards the close of this delightful honeymoon tour and it was a bright sunshiny morning early in february but february in paris is sometimes better than april in london
8461-278226-0007	but she fixed upon a picture which she said she preferred to anything she had seen in the gallery
8461-278226-0008	philip joslen was examining some pictures on the other side of the room when his wife made the discovery
8461-278226-0009	how i wish you could get me a copy of that picture of philip laura said entreatingly
8461-278226-0010	i should so like one to hang in my morning room at joscelin's rock
8461-278226-0011	she turned to the french artist presently and asked him where the elder mister curtis lived and if there was any possibility of seeing him
8461-278226-0012	they have said that he is even a little imbecile that he does not remember himself of the most common events of his life
8461-278226-0013	but there are some others who say that his memory has not altogether failed and that he's still enough harshly critical towards the works of others
8461-278226-0014	i don't think he will have any difficulty in finding the house
8461-278226-0015	you will be doing me such a favour phillip if you'll say yes
8461-258277-0000	when it was the seven hundred and eighteenth night
8461-258277-0001	but he answered needs must i have zaynab also now suddenly there came a rap at the door and the maid said who is at the door
8461-258277-0002	the knocker replied kama daughter of azara the jew say me isaly of khera with you
8461-258277-0003	replied the broker's daughter oh thou daughter of a dog
8461-258277-0004	and having thus islamised she asked him do men in the faith of al islam give marriage portions to women or do women dower men
8461-258277-0005	and she threw down the jew's head before him
8461-258277-0006	now the cause of her slaying her sire was as follows
8461-258277-0007	then he set out rejoicing to return to the barak of the forty
8461-258277-0008	so he ate and fell down senseless for the sweetmeats were drugged with bhang whereupon the kazi bundled him into the sack and made off with him charger and chest and all to the barrack of the forty
8461-258277-0009	presently hasan shuman came out of the closet and said to him hast thou gotten the gear o ali
8461-258277-0010	so he told him what had befallen him and added if i know whither the rascal is gone and where to find the knave i would pay him out
8461-258277-0011	knowest thou whither he went
8461-258277-0012	answered hasan i know where he is and opening the door of the closet showed him the sweetmeat cell within drugged and senseless
8461-258277-0013	so i went round about the highways of the city till i met a sweetmeat seller and buying his clothes and stock in trade and gear for ten dinars did what was done
8461-258277-0014	quoth arashid whose head is this
8461-258277-0015	so ali related to him all that passed from first to last and the caliph said i had not thought thou wouldst kill him for that he was a sovereign
8461-258277-0016	he replied i have forty lads but they are in cairo
3764-168670-0000	the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
3764-168670-0001	cosette had waked up
3764-168670-0002	jean valjean had placed her near the fire
3764-168670-0003	you will wait for me at a lady's house i shall come to fetch you
3764-168670-0004	everything is arranged and nothing is said fauchelevent
3764-168670-0005	i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
3764-168670-0006	that's where the difficulty lies
3764-168670-0007	it is easy enough with the child you will carry her out
3764-168670-0008	and she will hold her tongue i answer for that
3764-168670-0009	fouchelevent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean
3764-168670-0010	you understand father madeline the government will notice it
3764-168670-0011	jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
3764-168670-0012	foucheleveau went on
3764-168670-0013	it is to morrow that i am to bring you in the prioress expects you
3764-168670-0014	then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he roland was to render to the community
3764-168670-0015	that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
3764-168670-0016	that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
3764-168670-0017	that he fauchelevent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
3764-168670-0018	and then that there was another the empty coffin
3764-168670-0019	what is that empty coffin
3764-168670-0020	asked jean valjean feuilleton replied
3764-168670-0021	what coffee what administration
3764-168670-0022	fouchelevent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair you
3764-168670-0023	you know fernand what you have said mother crucifixion is dead
3764-168670-0024	and i add and father madeleine is buried
3764-168670-0025	you are not like other men father madeline
3764-168670-0026	this offers the means give me some information in the first place
3764-168670-0027	how long is the coffin six feet
3764-168670-0028	it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church what church
3764-168670-0029	the church in the street the church which anyone can enter
3764-168670-0030	have you the keys to those two doors
3764-168670-0031	no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
3764-168670-0032	only to allow the undertaker's men to enter when they come to get the coffin
3764-168670-0033	who nails up the coffin why i do
3764-168670-0034	who spreads the pall over it
3764-168670-0035	not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room that is even written on the wall
3764-168670-0036	could you hide me in that room to night when everyone is asleep
3764-168670-0037	about three o'clock in the afternoon
3764-168670-0038	i shall be hungry ah i will bring you something
3764-168670-0039	you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
3764-168670-0040	forcheville recoiled and cracked his finger joints but that is impossible
3764-168670-0041	bah impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
3764-168670-0042	jean valjean had been in worse straits than this
3764-168670-0043	any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
3764-168670-0044	what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
3764-168670-0045	to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bundle of goods to live for a long time in a box to find air where there is none to economise his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
3764-168670-0046	you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank loosely good and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
3764-168670-0047	a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
3764-168670-0048	who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
3764-168670-0049	the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacities
3764-168670-0050	but jean valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself he grumbled
3764-168670-0051	if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
3764-168670-0052	an old fellow of the old school the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
3764-168670-0053	i shall follow that is my business
3764-168670-0054	the horse halts the undertaker's men not a rope around your coffin and lower you down
3764-168670-0055	the priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
3764-168670-0056	one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
3764-168670-0057	that is settled father fauchelevent all will go well
3764-168671-0000	on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passers by on the boulevard du midin pulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skulls cross bones and tears
3764-168671-0001	this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
3764-168671-0002	a morning coat in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choirboy in his red cap followed
3764-168671-0003	behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along
3764-168671-0004	the grave diggers being thus bound to service in the evening and at night in winter in this seminary they were subjected to a special discipline
3764-168671-0005	these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalade
3764-168671-0006	dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
3764-168671-0007	the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the voisin it hinted at poverty pere lachasse if you please
3764-168671-0008	to be buried in pere lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany it is recognised as elegant
3764-168671-0009	the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the execution of jean valjean into the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly venial offence in our sight
3764-168671-0010	it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
3764-168671-0011	the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
3764-168671-0012	in the cloister what is called the government is only an intermediating with authority an interference which is always questionable
3764-168671-0013	make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
3764-168671-0014	a prince is nothing in the presence of a principal
3764-168671-0015	vaux laurens limped along behind the horse in a very contented frame of mind
3764-168671-0016	jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquilities which are contagious
3764-168671-0017	what remained to be done was a mere nothing
3764-168671-0018	he played with father mastian
3764-168671-0019	he did what he liked with him he made him dance according to his whim
3764-168671-0020	the permission for interment must be exhibited
3764-168671-0021	he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
3764-168671-0022	the man replied the grave digger
3764-168671-0023	the grave digger yes
3764-168671-0024	you i
3764-168671-0025	father mestien is the grave digger he was
3764-168671-0026	fouchard had expected anything but this but a grave digger could die
3764-168671-0027	it is true nevertheless that grave diggers do die themselves
3764-168671-0028	he had hardly the strength to stammer
3764-168671-0029	but he persisted feebly father mestien is the grave digger
3764-168671-0030	do you know who little father luna is he's a jug of red wine
3764-168671-0031	but you are a jolly fellow too
3764-168671-0032	are you not comrade we'll go and have a drink together presently
3764-168671-0033	the man replied
3764-168671-0034	he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
3764-168671-0035	the grave digger walked on in front of him
3764-168671-0036	faulconnel passed the unexpected crevier once more in review
3764-168671-0037	fouchelevent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker he muttered
3764-168671-0038	m so father mastien is dead
3764-168671-0039	the man replied completely
3764-168671-0040	the good god consulted his note book which shows when the time is up it was father mestien's turn father mestien died
3764-168671-0041	stammered fouchelevent it is made
3764-168671-0042	you are a peasant i am a parisian
3764-168671-0043	forchiveau thought i am lost
3764-168671-0044	there were only a few turns of the wheel distant from the small alley leading to the nun's corner
3764-168671-0045	and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well
3764-168671-0046	fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed
3764-168671-0047	my father was a porter at the priteneum town hall
3764-168671-0048	but he had reverses he had losses on change i was obliged to renounce the profession of author but i am still a public writer
3764-168671-0049	so you are not a grave digger then
3764-168671-0050	returned vauchelleville clutching at this branch feeble as it was
3764-168671-0051	here a remark becomes necessary
3764-168671-0052	de fleurville whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
3764-168671-0053	the grave digger went on with a superior smile
3764-168671-0054	one must eat
3997-182399-0000	old mister buzzard grinned
3997-182399-0001	this sounded like another story
3997-182399-0002	he was curious about that black haired cousin of old mister buzzard very curious indeed
3997-182399-0003	anyway he would find out
3997-182399-0004	please mister buzzard please tell us the story he begged
3997-182399-0005	now all mister buzzard is naturally good natured and accommodating and when peter begged so hard he just couldn't find it in his heart to refuse
3997-182399-0006	way back in the days when grandpa buzzard had his little falling out with old king eagle and done fly so high he scorched the feathers off his head he had a cousin did grandpa buzzard and this cousin was just naturally lazy and no count
3997-182399-0007	like most no count people he used to make a regular nuisance of himself poking his nose into everybody's business and never tending to his own
3997-182399-0008	wasn't anything going on that this trifling member of the buzzard family didn't find out about and meddle in he could ask more questions than peter rabbit can and anybody that can do that has got to ask a lot
3997-182399-0009	everybody looked at peter and laughed
3997-182399-0010	so weans set on the chimney tops whenever old jack frost gets to straying down where he have no business
3997-182399-0011	one day this no count trifling cousin of grandpa bozard got cold in his feet
3997-182399-0012	it was on the little old house a little old tumble down house
3997-182399-0013	why he just stretch his full head as far down that chimney as he can and listen and listen
3997-182399-0014	but he don't mind that
3997-182399-0015	will you all please speak a little louder he hollered down the chimney just like that
3997-182399-0016	yes sah she sho'ly was plum scared
3997-182399-0017	they liked to chuck that no count boss to death
3997-182399-0018	when he get home he try and try to brush that suit off but it done get into the skin and it stay there
3997-182399-0019	a little sigh of satisfaction went round the circle of listeners
3997-182399-0020	it was just as good as one of grandfather frogs
3997-180294-0000	the duke comes every morning they will tell him when he comes that i am asleep and perhaps he will wait until i awake
3997-180294-0001	yes but if i should already ask for something what
3997-180294-0002	well do it for me for i swear to you that i don't love you as the others have loved you
3997-180294-0003	there are bolts in the door wretch
3997-180294-0004	i don't know how it is but it seems to me as if i do
3997-180294-0005	now go i can't keep my eyes open
3997-180294-0006	it seemed to me as if this sleeping city belonged to me i searched my memory for the names of those whose happiness i had once envied and i could not recall one without finding myself the happier
3997-180294-0007	education family feeling the sense of duty the family are strong sentinels but there are no sentinels so vigilant as not to be deceived by a girl of sixteen to whom nature by the voice of the man she loves gives the first counsel of love all the more ardent because they seem so pure
3997-180294-0008	the more a girl believes in goodness the more easily will she give way if not to her lover at least to love for being without mistrust she is without force and to win her love is a triumph that can be gained by any young man of five and twenty see how young girls are watched and guarded
3997-180294-0009	then how surely must they desire the world which is hidden from them how surely must they find it tempting how surely must they listen to the first voice which comes to tell its secrets through their bars and bless the hand which is the first to raise a corner of the mystery veil
3997-180294-0010	with them the body has worn out the soul the senses have burned up the heart dissipation has blunted the feelings
3997-180294-0011	they love by profession and not by instinct
3997-180294-0012	when a creature who has all her past to reproach herself with is taken all at once by a profound sincere irresistible love of which she had never felt herself capable when she has confessed her love how absolutely the man whom she loves dominates her
3997-180294-0013	they know not what proof to give
3997-180294-0014	in order to disturb the laborers in the field was one day devoured by a wolf because those whom he had so often deceived no longer believed in his cries for help
3997-180294-0015	this is the same with these unhappy women when they love seriously
3997-180294-0016	but when the man who inspires this redeeming love is great enough in soul to receive it without remembering the past when he gives himself up to it when in short he loves as he is loved this man drains at one draught all earthly emotions and after such a love his heart will be closed to every other
3997-180294-0017	but to return to the first day of my leisure
3997-180294-0018	when i reached home i was in a state of mad gayety
3997-180294-0019	the woman becomes the man's mistress and loves him
3997-180294-0020	how why
3997-180294-0021	my whole being was exalted into joy at the memory of the words we had exchanged during that first night
3997-180294-0022	here are my orders to night at the vaudeville
3997-180294-0023	come during the third entrante
3997-180294-0024	the boxes filled one after another
3997-180294-0025	only one remains empty the stage box
3997-180294-0026	at the beginning of the third act i heard the door of the box on which my eyes had been almost constantly fixed open and marguerite appeared
3997-180294-0027	did she love me enough to believe that the more beautiful she looked the happier i should be
3997-180294-0028	what is the matter with you to night said marguerite rising and coming to the back of the box and kissing me on the forehead
3997-180294-0029	you should go to bed she replied with that ironical air which went so well with her delicate and witty face
3997-180294-0030	where at home
3997-180294-0031	you still love me can you ask
3997-180294-0032	because you don't like seeing him
3997-180294-0033	none the less i was very unhappy all the rest of the evening and went away very sadly after having seen prudence the count and marguerite get into the carriage which was waiting for them at the door
3997-180297-0000	i have not come to hinder you from leaving paris
3997-180297-0001	you in the way marguerite but how
3997-180297-0002	well you might have had a woman here said prudence and it would hardly have been amusing for her to see two more arrive
3997-180297-0003	during this remark marguerite looked at me attentively
3997-180297-0004	my dear prudence i answered you do not know what you are saying
3997-180297-0005	yes but besides not wishing to put you out i was sure that if you came as far as my door you would want to come up and as i could not let you i did not wish to let you go away blaming me for saying no
3997-180297-0006	because i am watched and the least suspicion might do me the greatest harm
3997-180297-0007	is that really the only reason
3997-180297-0008	if there were any other i would tell you for we are not to have any secrets from one another now
3997-180297-0009	honestly do you care for me a little a great deal
3997-180297-0010	i fancied for a moment that i might give myself that happiness for six months you would not have it you insisted on knowing the means
3997-180297-0011	well good heavens the means were easy enough to guess
3997-180297-0012	i listened and i gazed at marguerite with admiration
3997-180297-0013	when i thought that this marvelous creature whose feet i had once longed to kiss was willing to let me take my place in her thoughts my part in her life and that i was not yet content with what she gave me i asked if man's desire had indeed limits when satisfied as promptly as mine had been it reached after something further
3997-180297-0014	truly she continued we poor creatures of chance have fantastic desire and inconceivable loves
3997-180297-0015	we are not allowed to have hearts under the penalty of being hooted down and of ruining our credit
3997-180297-0016	we no longer belong to ourselves
3997-180297-0017	we stand first in their self esteem last in their esteem
3997-180297-0018	never do they give you advice which is not lucrative
3997-180297-0019	it means little enough to them that we should have ten lovers extra as long as they get dresses or a bracelet out of them and that they can drive in our carriage from time to time or come to our box at the theatre
3997-180297-0020	such a man i found in the duke but the duke is old and old age neither protects nor consoles
3997-180297-0021	i thought i could accept the life which he offered me but what would you have
3997-180297-0022	what i loved in you was not the man who was but the man who was going to be
3997-180297-0023	marguerite tired out with this long confession threw herself back on the sofa and to stifle a slight cough put up her handkerchief to her lips and from that to her eyes
3997-180297-0024	marguerite do with me as you will i am your slave your dog but in the name of heaven tear up the letter which i wrote to you and do not make me leave you to morrow it would kill me
3997-180297-0025	marguerite drew the letter from her bosom and handing it to me with a smile of infinite sweetness said
3997-180297-0026	here it is i have brought it back
3997-180297-0027	i tore the letter into fragments and kissed with tears the hand that gave it to me
3997-180297-0028	look here prudence do you know what he wants said marguerite
3997-180297-0029	he wants you to forgive him
3997-180297-0030	one has to but he wants more than that what then
3997-180297-0031	i embraced marguerite until she was almost stifled
4294-14317-0000	as i thought that this was due to some fault in the earth i wanted to make these first experiments before i undertook my perseus
4294-14317-0001	when i saw that this bust came out sharp and clean i set at once to construct a little furnace in the workshop erected for me by the duke after my own plans and design in the house which the duke had given me
4294-14317-0002	it was an extremely difficult task and i was anxious to observe all the niceties of art which i had learned so as not to lapse into some error
4294-14317-0003	i in my turn feel the same desire and hope to play my part like them therefore my lord give me the leave to go
4294-14317-0004	but beware of letting ben nelo quit you rather bestow upon him always more than he demands for if he goes into foreign parts his ignorance is so presumptuous that he is just the man to disgrace our most illustrious school
4294-14317-0005	i ask no further reward for my labours up to this time than the gracious favour of your most illustrious excellency
4294-14317-0006	then i thanked him and said i had no greater desire than to show those envious folk that i had it in me to execute the promised work
4294-14317-0007	i had better look to my conduct for it had come to his ears that i relied upon his favour to take in first one man and then another
4294-14317-0008	i begged his most illustrious excellency to name a single person whom i had ever taken in
4294-14317-0009	i said my lord i thank you and beg you to condescend so far as to listen to four words it is true that he lent me a pair of old scales two anvils and three little hammers which articles i begged his workman george de corteona fifteen days ago to fetch back
4294-14317-0010	george came for them himself
4294-14317-0011	i hope to prove on what account that scoundrel tries to bring me into disgrace
4294-14317-0012	when he had heard this speech the duke rose up in anger and sent for barnadone who was forced to take flight as far as venice he and antonia lando with him
4294-14317-0013	you had better put this to the proof and i will go at once to the bargello
4294-14317-0014	i am willing to enter into competition with the ancients and feel able to surpass them for since those early days in high esteem in like manner i could make for you large pieces of gold and silver plate as i did so often for that noble monarch king francis of france thanks to the great conveniences he allowed me without ever losing time for the execution of colossal statues or other works of the sculptor's craft
4294-14317-0015	after several months were wasted and pierre would neither work nor put men to work upon the piece i made him give it back
4294-14317-0016	among artists certain enraged sculptors laughed at me and called me the new sculptor
4294-14317-0017	now i hope to show them that i am an old sculptor if god shall grant me the boon of finishing my perseus for that noble piazza of his most illustrious excellency
4294-14317-0018	having this excellent resolve in heart i reached my home
4294-35475-0000	but the middle son was little and lame he was neither dark nor fair he was neither handsome nor strong
4294-35475-0001	throwing himself on his knees before the king he cried o royal sire bestow upon me also a sword and a steed that i may up and away to follow my brethren
4294-35475-0002	but the king laughed him to scorn thou a swordsman he quoth
4294-35475-0003	in sooth thou shalt have one but it shall be one befitting thy maiden's size and courage if so small a weapon can be found in all my kingdom
4294-35475-0004	forthwith the grinning jester began shrieking with laughter so that the bells upon his motley cap were all set a jangling
4294-35475-0005	i did but laugh to think the sword of effleryd had been so quickly found responded the jester and he pointed to the scissors hanging from the tailor's girdle
4294-35475-0006	one night as he lay in a deep forest too unhappy to sleep he heard a noise near at hand in the bushes
4294-35475-0007	thou shalt have thy liberty he cried even though thou shouldst rend me in pieces the moment thou art free
4294-35475-0008	it had suddenly disappeared and in its place stood a beautiful fairy with filmy wings which shone like rainbows in the moonlight
4294-35475-0009	at this moment there was a distant rumbling as of thunder tis the ogre cried the fairy we must hasten
4294-35475-0010	scissors grow a giant's height and save us from the ogre's might
4294-35475-0011	he could see the ogre standing powerless to hurt him on the other side of the chasm and gnashing his teeth each one of which was as big as a millstone
4294-35475-0012	the sight was so terrible that he turned on his heel and fled away as fast as his feet could carry him
4294-35475-0013	thou shalt not be left a prisoner in this dismal spot while i have the power to help thee
4294-35475-0014	he lifted the scissors and with one stroke destroyed the weed and gave the fly its freedom
4294-35475-0015	a faint glimmer of light on the opposite wall shows me the keyhole
4294-35475-0016	the prince spent all the following time until midnight trying to think of a suitable verse to say to the scissors
4294-35475-0017	as he uttered the words the scissors leaped out of his hand and began to cut through the wooden shutters as easily as through a cheese
4294-35475-0018	in a very short time the prince had crawled through the opening
4294-35475-0019	while he stood looking around him in bewilderment a firefly alighted on his arm flashing its little lantern in the prince's face it cried this way my friend the fly sent me to guide you to a place of safety
4294-35475-0020	what is to become of me cried the poor peasant
4294-35475-0021	my grain must fall and rot in the field from over ripeness because i have not the strength to rise and harvest it then indeed must we all starve
4294-35475-0022	the grand dame whom he supplied with faggots the merchant whom he rescued from robbers the king's counsellor to whom he gave aid all unsought and such as he helped straightway became his friends
4294-35475-0023	to him who could bring her back to her father's castle should be given the throne and kingdom as well as the princess herself so from far and near indeed from almost every country under the sun came knights and princes to fight the ogre
4294-35475-0024	among those who drew back were ethelred's brothers the three that were dark and the three that were fair
4294-35475-0025	but ethel reed heeded not their taunts
4294-35475-0026	so they all cried out long and loud long live the prince prince ciso
4294-9934-0000	he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within it it feels only the wound the quiver of the germ and the joy of the fruit only arrive later
4294-9934-0001	he had but just acquired a faith must he then reject it already
4294-9934-0002	he affirmed to himself that he would not he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
4294-9934-0003	to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls
4294-9934-0004	marius was clear eyed and he required the true light
4294-9934-0005	the half lights of doubt pained him
4294-9934-0006	whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
4294-9934-0007	he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
4294-9934-0008	his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
4294-9934-0009	in the troubled state of his conscience he no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
4294-9934-0010	they soon elbowed him abruptly
4294-9934-0011	request courfeyrac to come and talk with me said marius
4294-9934-0012	what is to become of you said kiferak
4294-9934-0013	what are you going to do i do not know
4294-9934-0014	silver gold here it is
4294-9934-0015	you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat and my boots
4294-9934-0016	that will be enough
4294-9934-0017	no it is not good what will you do after that
4294-9934-0018	do you know german no
4294-9934-0019	it is badly paid work but one can live by it
4294-9934-0020	the clothes dealer was sent for
4294-9934-0021	he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments they went to the watchmakers
4294-9934-0022	he bought the watch for forty five francs
4294-9934-0023	hello i had forgotten that said marius
4294-9934-0024	the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
4294-9934-0025	i have ten francs left said marius
4294-9934-0026	that'll be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred sous very slowly
4294-9934-0027	one morning on his return from the law school marius found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistoles that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
4294-9934-0028	marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
4294-9934-0029	at that moment he had three francs left
4294-32859-0000	walder was rather surly after the ladies had floated away from the scene and he drank his liquor doggedly
4294-32859-0001	it was his fancy i suppose to revive certain sentimental relations which had it may be once existed between him and miss lake and he was a person of that combative temperament that magnifies an object in proportion as its pursuit is thwarted
4294-32859-0002	the story of freidelin and wretch's pretty outlines
4294-32859-0003	sit down beside me and i'll tell you the story
4294-32859-0004	he assisted at it but took no part and in fact was listening to that other conversation which sounded with its pleasant gabble and laughter like a little musical tinkle of bells in the distance
4294-32859-0005	but honest mark forgot that young ladies do not always come out quite alone and jump unassisted into their vehicles
1688-142285-0000	there's iron they say in all our blood and a grain or two perhaps is good but his he makes me harshly feel has got a little too much of steel anon
1688-142285-0001	margaret said mister hale as he returned from showing his guests downstairs i could not help watching your face with some anxiety when mister thornton made his confession of having been a shop boy
1688-142285-0002	you don't mean that you thought me so silly
1688-142285-0003	i really liked that account of himself better than anything else he said
1688-142285-0004	his statement of having been a shop boy was the thing i liked best of all
1688-142285-0005	you who were always accusing people of being shop at helstone
1688-142285-0006	i don't think mister hale you have done quite right in introducing such a person to us without telling us what he had been
1688-142285-0007	i really was very much afraid of showing him how much shocked i was at some parts of what he said
1688-142285-0008	his father dying in miserable circumstances
1688-142285-0009	why it might have been in the workhouse
1688-142285-0010	his father speculated wildly failed and then killed himself because he could not bear the disgrace
1688-142285-0011	all his former friends shrank from the disclosures that had to be made of his dishonest gambling wild hopeless struggles made with other people's money to regain his own moderate portion of wealth
1688-142285-0012	no one came forwards to help the mother and this boy
1688-142285-0013	at least no friend came forwards immediately and mister thornton is not one i fancy to wait till tardy kindness comes to find her out
1688-142285-0014	so they left milton
1688-142285-0015	how tainted asked her father
1688-142285-0016	oh papa by that testing everything by the standard of wealth
1688-142285-0017	when he spoke of the mechanical powers he evidently looked upon them only as new ways of extending trade and making money
1688-142285-0018	and the poor men around him they were poor because they were vicious out of the pale of his sympathies because they had not his iron nature and the capabilities that it gives him for being rich
1688-142285-0019	not vicious he never said that
1688-142285-0020	improvident and self indulgent were his words
1688-142285-0021	margaret was collecting her mother's working materials and preparing to go to bed
1688-142285-0022	just as she was leaving the room she hesitated she was inclined to make an acknowledgment which she thought would please her father but which to be full and true must include a little annoyance
1688-142285-0023	however out it came
1688-142285-0024	papa i do think mister thornton a very remarkable man but personally i don't like him at all
1688-142285-0025	and i do said her father laughing
1688-142285-0026	personally as you call it and all
1688-142285-0027	i don't set him up for a hero or anything of that kind
1688-142285-0028	but good night child
1688-142285-0029	there were several other signs of something wrong about missus hale
1688-142285-0030	she and dixon held mysterious consultations in the bedroom from which dixon would come out crying and cross as was her custom when any distress of her mistress called upon her sympathy
1688-142285-0031	once margaret had gone into the chamber soon after dixon left it and found her mother on her knees and as margaret stole out she caught a few words which were evidently a prayer for strength and patience to endure severe bodily suffering
1688-142285-0032	but though she received caresses and fond words back again in such profusion as would have gladdened her formerly yet she felt that there was a secret withheld from her and she believed it bore serious reference to her mother's health
1688-142285-0033	she lay awake very long this night planning how to lessen the evil influence of the milton life on her mother
1688-142285-0034	a servant to give dixon permanent assistance should be got if she gave up the whole time to the search and then at any rate her mother might have all the personal attention she required and had been accustomed to her whole life
1688-142285-0035	visiting registrar offices seeing all manner of unlikely people and very few in the least likely absorbed margaret's time and thoughts for several days
1688-142285-0036	one afternoon she met bessie higgins in the street and stopped to speak to her
1688-142285-0037	well bissy how are you
1688-142285-0038	better and not better if you know what that means
1688-142285-0039	not exactly replied margaret smiling
1688-142285-0040	i'm better in not being torn to pieces by cocking or knights but i'm weary and tired of milton and longing to get away to the land of boola and when i think i'm farther and farther off my heart thinks and i'm no better i'm worse
1688-142285-0041	margaret turned round to walk alongside of the girl in her feeble progress homeward
1688-142285-0042	but for a minute or two she did not speak
1688-142285-0043	at last she said in a low voice
1688-142285-0044	bessie do you wish to die
1688-142285-0045	bessie was silent in her turn for a minute or two then she replied
1688-142285-0046	not worse than many others i reckon
1688-142285-0047	but what was it
1688-142285-0048	you know i'm a stranger here so perhaps i'm not so quick at understanding what you mean as if i'd lived all my life in milton
1688-142285-0049	i had forgotten what i said for the time continued margaret quietly
1688-142285-0050	i should have thought of it again when i was less busy may i go with you now
1688-142285-0051	the sharpness in her eye turned to a wistful longing as she met margaret's soft and friendly gaze
1688-142285-0052	as they turned up into a small court opening out into a squalid street bessy said
1688-142285-0053	you'll not be daunted if father's at home and speaks a bit gruffish at first
1688-142285-0054	but nicholas was not at home when they entered
1688-142285-0055	gasped bessie at last
1688-142285-0056	bessy took a long and feverish draught and then fell back and shut her eyes
1688-142285-0057	margaret bent over and said bessie don't be impatient with your life whatever it is or may have been
1688-142285-0058	remember who gave it to you and made it what it is
1688-142285-0059	now i'll not have my wench preached to
1688-142285-0060	but surely said margaret facing round you believe in what i said that god gave her life and ordered what kind of life it was to be
1688-142285-0061	i believe what i see and no more
1688-142285-0062	that's what i believe young woman
1688-142285-0063	i don't believe all i hear no not by a big deal
1688-142285-0064	but who's come at last and who's welcome as long as he'll keep from preaching on what who knows naught about
1688-142285-0065	it's simple and not far to fetch nor hard to work
1688-142285-0066	but the girl only pleaded the more with margaret
1688-142285-0067	don't think hardly on him he's a good man he is
1688-142285-0068	i sometimes think i shall be mourned with sorrow even in the city of god if father is not there
1688-142285-0069	the feverish colour came into her cheeks and the feverish flame into her eye
1688-142285-0070	but you'll be there father you shall oh my heart
1688-142285-0071	she put her hand to it and became ghastly pale
1688-142285-0072	margaret held her in her arms and put the weary head to rest upon her bosom
1688-142285-0073	presently the spasm that foreshadowed death had passed away and bessy roused herself and said
1688-142285-0074	i'll go to bed it's best place but catching at margaret's gown you'll come again i know you will but just say it
1688-142285-0075	i'll come to morrow said margaret
1688-142285-0076	margaret went away very sad and thoughtful
1688-142285-0077	she was late for tea at home
1688-142285-0078	have you met with a servant dear
1688-142285-0079	no mamma that anne buckley would never have done
1688-142285-0080	spose i try said mister hale
1688-142285-0081	everybody else has had their turn at this great difficulty now let me try
1688-142285-0082	i may be the cinderella to put on the slipper after all
1688-142285-0083	what would you do papa how would you set about it
1688-142285-0084	well i i would apply it to some good housekeeper to recommend me one known to herself or her servants
1688-142285-0085	very good but we must first catch our house mother
1688-142285-0086	the mother of whom he spoke to us said margaret
1688-142285-0087	mister thornton the only mother he has i believe said mister hale quietly
1688-142285-0088	i shall like to see her she must be an uncommon person her mother added
1688-142285-0089	perhaps she may have a relation who might suit us and be glad of our place
1688-142285-0090	she sounded to be such a careful economical person that i should like any one out of the same family
1688-142285-0091	my dear said mister hale alarmed pray don't go off on that idea
1688-142285-0092	i'm sure at any rate she would not like strangers to know anything about it
1688-142285-0093	take notice that this is not my kind of haughtiness papa if i have any at all which i don't agree to though you're always accusing me of it
1688-142285-0094	i don't know positively that it is hers either but from little things i have gathered from him i fancy so
1688-142285-0095	they cared too little to ask in what manner her son had spoken about her
4852-28330-0000	they went down to their quarters first
4852-28330-0001	guess mister finney went to his quarters i don't remember seeing him cross the deck or come over that way at all
4852-28330-0002	next ned sillly was relieved of the helm by elbert jones who took over ned went on down
4852-28330-0003	it looks to me as if it could have been one of several people and i'll be switched if i know who keep my eyes open
4852-28330-0004	the miriam belle was nearing tee-hee
4852-28330-0005	we've water in fresh stores to take on there
4852-28330-0006	chris lost no time as soon as he could do it without being noticed in hurrying down to his cabin
4852-28330-0007	certainly my boy boomed out the captain his blue eyes abruptly keen and penetrating
4852-28330-0008	mister phineas will be some time on deck we cannot be overheard in here
4852-28330-0009	his face rose with nervousness that this might not do as an answer and he stood stiff and still before captain blizzard
4852-28330-0010	the captain sat forward in his chair looking at him for a long moment considering
4852-28330-0011	then he said well i do not care for it i cannot say that i do
4852-28330-0012	this ship is more to me than wife or mother or family
4852-28330-0013	he paused fingering his lower lip and looking sideways in a reflective fashion at chris standing before him
4852-28330-0014	we shall say no more but i trust you understand the responsibility you have
4852-28330-0015	this ship its cargo and its men will be in your hands
4852-28330-0016	yes sir i think i can do it safely or i should not try sir
4852-28330-0017	captain blizzard's round pink face creased in its winning smile
4852-28330-0018	he then went on to describe what else was to follow the covering of a ship with leaves to make it blend with its surroundings
4852-28330-0019	camphloge was not a word the captain or anyone else of his time had understood
4852-28330-0020	what can be said during that time sir chris thought to ask
4852-28330-0021	i am somewhat skilled in mechanics i have to be as a captain of a ship and the crew know it
4852-28330-0022	i shall say that you are in my own cabin so that i can care for you
4852-28330-0023	not since he had left mister wicker and chris felt such confidence as he did in the words and actions of captain blizzard
4852-28330-0024	he knew now that his absence for as long as he had to be away would be covered up and satisfactorily accounted for
4852-28330-0025	their conversation had taken some little while
4852-28319-0000	the learning of magic was by no means easy
4852-28319-0001	he had told his master at once about simon gostler his hoard of money and his hiding places for it
4852-28319-0002	chris therefore threw himself into all the prominences of his task
4852-28319-0003	one afternoon when he had returned after a rest to mister wicker's study he saw that there was something new in the room a bowl with a gold fish in it stood on the table but mister wicker was not to be seen
4852-28319-0004	what should i do first
4852-28319-0005	how you've improved my boy he exclaimed it is now time for you to try and this is as good a change as any
4852-28319-0006	suppose i change and can't change back
4852-28319-0007	mister wucker waited patiently beside him for a few moments for chris to get up his courage
4852-28319-0008	then as nothing happened with a voice like a whip mister wicker said start at once
4852-28319-0009	the sensation spread faster and faster
4852-28319-0010	his head swam and he felt faint and a little sick but he persisted through the final words
4852-28319-0011	he thought not without a feeling of pride and commenced experimenting with his tail and fins with such enthusiasm and delight that some little time elapsed before mister wicker's voice boomed below
4852-28319-0012	seventy four book one the return
4852-28319-0013	the figures shoes carved in some eastern style had curved at pointing toes
4852-28319-0014	then all at once the idea came to chris
4852-28319-0015	if he was to be a magician could he make this boy come to life
4852-28319-0016	he squatted on his haunches examined the carved wooden figure attentively and felt convinced that once alive the boy would be an ideal and happy companion
4852-28319-0017	but how did one change inanimate to animate
4852-28319-0018	gris got up and stole back to mister wicker's door
4852-28319-0019	he heard the magician going up the spiral staircase to his room above and after changing himself to a mouse to slip under the door and see that the room was really empty wizard's proper shape and opened the doors of the cupboard at the far end of the room
4852-28319-0020	the afternoon raining before increased in storm
4852-28319-0021	thus came two hours before its time thunder snarls in the sky
4852-28319-0022	certain elements were to be mixed and poured at the proper time
4852-28319-0023	mister wicker began moving about upstairs the floorboards creaked creak and still chris could not leave until the faction foamed and glowed
4852-28319-0024	with infinite caution chris closed the door silently behind him and running lightly forward reached the figure of the negro boy
4852-28319-0025	was as if the stiffness melted
4852-28319-0026	under his eyes wet folds of cloth became rich silk embroidery gleamed in its reality upon the coat and oh the face
4852-28319-0027	the wooden grin loosened the large eyes turned the hand holding the hard bouquet of carved flowers moved and let the bouquet fall
4852-28311-0000	say you know something
4852-28311-0001	chris looked from a nickel plated flashlight to a car jack and spark plug
4852-28311-0002	no who needs a job bad that's jakey harris
4852-28311-0003	oh yes he said
4852-28311-0004	only why didn't you ask him yourself
4852-28311-0005	mike became uneasy and fished an elastic band out of his pocket made a flick of paper and sent it soaring out into em street
4852-28311-0006	well he admitted i did
4852-28311-0007	chris asked and for the first time that day the heavy weight he carried within him lifted and lightened a little
4852-28311-0008	think he really needs it he pursued
4852-28311-0009	he would have liked to get the job for jakey who needed it but somehow the task of facing mister wicker especially now that the light was going and dusk edged into the streets was not what chris intended for ending the afternoon
4852-28311-0010	mike's expression changed at once to one of triumph but bris was only partially encouraged
4852-28311-0011	bet you aren't going after all there's turned to him
4852-28311-0012	mike was standing on the corner
4852-28311-0013	ah sharks
4852-28311-0014	chris started off once more passing a bleak little victorian church perched on the hill above mister wicker's house
4852-28311-0015	an empty lot cut into by church lane gave a look of isolation to the ell shaped brick building that served mister wicker's both house and place of business
4852-28311-0016	the longer wing toward the back had a back door that opened on a water street the space between the house and wisconsin avenue had been made into a neat oblong flower garden fenced off from the sidewalk by box shrubs and a white picket fence
4852-28311-0017	a livid yellow stained the horizon beyond the factories and grey clouds lowered and tumbled above
4852-28311-0018	the air was growing chill and chris decided to finish the job
4852-28311-0019	all at once he wondered how his mother was and everything in him was pinched and tightened itself
4852-28311-0020	at the foot of the hill he reached the house
4852-28311-0021	there were three things that always caught his eye amid the litter of dusty pieces
4852-28311-0022	on the left the coil of rope in the centre the model of a sailing ship in a glass bottle and on the right the wooden statue of a negro boy in baggy trousers turkish jacket and white turban
4852-28311-0023	but the name still showed at the prow and many a time chris safe at home in bed had sailed imaginary voyages in the mirabelle
4852-28311-0024	he had never seen anyone go into mister wicker's shop now he thought of that
4852-28311-0025	how then did he live and what did he ever sell
4852-28311-0026	a sudden carharan walk him from this stream
4852-28312-0000	of the many times he had examined mister wicker's window and poured over the rope the ship and the nubian boy he had never got into mister wicker's shop
4852-28312-0001	so now alone until some one should answer the bell he looked eagerly if uneasily around him
4852-28312-0002	what with the one window and the lowering day outside the long narrow shop was sombre
4852-28312-0003	heavy hand in beams crossed it from one side to the other
4852-28312-0004	mister wicker's back being toward the source of light chris could not see his face
4852-28312-0005	the double fans of minute wrinkles breaking from eye corner to temple and joining with those over the cheek bones were drawn into the horizontal lines across the domed forehead
4852-28312-0006	little tufts of white fuzz above the ears were all that remained of the antiquarian's hair but what drew and held chris's gaze was the old man's eyes
4852-28312-0007	chris blinked and looked again yes they were still there
4852-28312-0008	chris swallowed and his voice came back to him
4852-28312-0009	yes sir he said
4852-28312-0010	i saw your sign and i know a boy who needs the job
4852-28312-0011	he's a schoolmaster mine
4852-28312-0012	jake hearn's name is and he really needs the job
4852-28312-0013	i i just wondered if the place was still open
4852-28312-0014	what he saw was a fresh cheeked lad tall for thirteen sturdy with sincerity and good humor in his face and something sensitive and appealing about his eyes
4852-28312-0015	he guessed there must be a lively fire in that room beyond
4852-28312-0016	would that interfere with jake getting the job sir
4852-28312-0017	but even as he slowly turned the thought pierced his mind why had he not seen the reflection of the headlights of the cars moving up and down the corner of wall street and up the hill toward the electric signals
4852-28312-0018	the room seemed overly still
4852-28312-0019	then in that second he turned and faced about
4852-28312-0020	the wide bow window was there before him the three objects he liked best showing frosty in the moonlight that poured in from across the water
4852-28312-0021	across the water where is the freeway
4852-28312-0022	it was no longer there nor were the high walls and smoke stacks of factories to be seen
4852-28312-0023	the warehouses were still there
4852-28312-0024	flapper gasped and breathless chris was unaware that he had moved closer to peer out the window in every direction
4852-28312-0025	no electric signs no lamp lit streets
4852-28312-0026	where the people's drug store had stood but half an hour before rose the roofs of what was evidently an inn
4852-28312-0027	a courtyard was scarcely lit by a flaring torch or two showing a swinging sign hung on a post
4852-28312-0028	the post was planted at the edge of what was now a broad and muddy road
4852-28312-0029	a coach with its top piled high with luggage stamped to a halt beside the flight court yard
4852-28312-0030	they moved into the inn the coach rattled off to the stable
4852-28312-0031	my window has a power for those few who are to see
1998-29454-0000	a thousand blessings from a grateful heart
1998-29454-0001	perusal said the pawnbroker that's the way to pronounce it
1998-29454-0002	his books told him that treasure is best hidden under loose boards and as of course your house has a secret panel which his had not
1998-29454-0003	he got it up and pushed his treasures as far in as he could along the rough crumbly surface of the lass and plaster
1998-29454-0004	when dicky came down his aunt slightly slapped him and he took the halfpenny and limped off obediently
1998-29454-0005	he had never seen one before and it interested him extremely
1998-29454-0006	he looked about him and knew that he did not at all know where he was
1998-29454-0007	what's up matey lost your way dicky explained
1998-29454-0008	when he said have i been asleep
1998-29454-0009	here we are said the man
1998-29454-0010	not exactly said the man but it's all right
1998-29454-0011	when it was over the man asked dicky if he could walk a little way and when dicky said he could they set out in the most friendly way side by side
1998-29454-0012	and the tea and all and the egg
1998-29454-0013	and this is the prettiest place ever i see
1998-29454-0014	i shall keep it a fair treat as it is
1998-29454-0015	she was waiting for the wood to buy the kettle when i came out mother
1998-29454-0016	and bad when she's in a good temper
1998-29454-0017	that ain't what you be in when you gets back
1998-29454-0018	i got to stick it said dicky sadly i'd best be getting home
1998-29454-0019	i wouldn't go home not if i was you said the man
1998-29454-0020	no said dicky oh no no i never

1998-29454-0022	well they'll show you the sort of man i am
1998-29454-0023	the man's manner was so kind and hearty the whole adventure was so wonderful and new is it country where you're going
1998-29454-0024	the sun shot long golden beams through the gaps in the hatch
1998-29454-0025	a bird paused in its flight on a branch quite close and clung there swaying
1998-29454-0026	he took out of his pocket a new envelope a new sheet of paper and a new pencil ready sharpened by machinery
1998-29454-0027	and i asked you let me come along o you got that
1998-29454-0028	get it wrote down then done
1998-29454-0029	then he folded it and put it in his pocket
1998-29454-0030	now we're square he said
1998-29454-0031	they could put a man away for less than that
1998-29454-0032	i see that there in a book said dicky chummed
1998-29454-0033	he rewarded the wake the last of the english and i wondered what it stood for
1998-29454-0034	white ones and half the size i lay
1998-29454-0035	adventures i should think so
1998-29454-0036	ah said dicky and a full silence fell between them
1998-29454-0037	that was charming but it was pleasant too to wash the mud off on the wet grass
1998-29454-0038	dickie always remembered that moment
1998-29454-0039	so you shall said mister beale a regular wash all over this very night i always like a wash myself
1998-29454-0040	some blokes think it pays to be dirty but it don't
1998-29454-0041	if you're clean they say honest poverty and if you're dirty they say serve you right
1998-29454-0042	you are good said dicky i do like you
1998-29454-0043	i know you will said dicky with enthusiasm i know how good you are
1998-29454-0044	bless me said mister bee uncomfortably well there
1998-29454-0045	step out sonny or we'll never get there this side of christmas
1998-29454-0046	well you'll know all about it presently
1998-15444-0000	if called to a case supposed or suspected to be one of poisoning the medical man has two duties to perform to save the patient's life and to place himself in a position to give evidence if called on to do so
1998-15444-0001	he should make inquiries as to symptoms and time at which food or medicine was last taken
1998-15444-0002	he should notice the position and temperature of the body the condition of rigor mortis marks of violence appearance of lips and mouth
1998-15444-0003	in making a post mortem examination the alimentary canal should be removed and preserved for further investigation
1998-15444-0004	the gut and the gall bladder being cut across between these ligaments the stomach may be removed entirely without spilling its contents
1998-15444-0005	if the medical practitioner is in doubt on any point he should obtain technical assistance from some one who has paid attention to the subject
1998-15444-0006	in a case of attempted suicide by poisoning is it the duty of the doctor to inform the police
1998-15444-0007	the best automaton is that which is at hand
1998-15444-0008	the dose for an adult is ten minims
1998-15444-0009	epimorphic is not allied in physiological action to morphine and may be given in cases of narcotic poisoning
1998-15444-0010	tickling the fowls with a feather may excite wallowing
1998-15444-0011	in using the elastic stomach tube some fluid should be introduced into the stomach before attempting to empty it or a portion of the mucus membrane may be sucked into the aperture
1998-15444-0012	the tube should be examined to see that it is not broken or cracked as accidents have happened from neglecting this precaution
1998-15444-0013	antidotes are usually given hypodermically or if their mouths in the form of tablets
1998-15444-0014	in the absence of a hypodermic syringe the remedy may be given by the rectum
1998-15444-0015	notice the smell colour and general appearance of the matter submitted for examination
1998-15444-0016	for the separation of an oxyhaemoglobin the following is the process of star's otto
1998-15444-0017	this process is based upon the principle that the salts of the electrolytes are soluble in ether and insoluble in ether
1998-15444-0018	the pure ecoles with the exception of morpheen in its crystalline form are soluble in ether
1998-15444-0019	two cool the mixture and filter wash the residue with strong alcohol and mix the filtrates
1998-15444-0020	the residue may be set aside for the detection of the metallic poisons if suspected expel the arsenic by careful evaporation
1998-15444-0021	on the evaporation of the alcohol the vaporizer and fatty matter separate
1998-15444-0022	evaporate the filtrate to a sirup and extract with successive portions of absolute alcohol
1998-15444-0023	separate the ethereal solution and evaporate
1998-15444-0024	five a part of this ethereal solution is poured into a wash glass and allowed to evaporate
1998-15444-0025	to purify it add a small quantity of dilute sulphuric acid and after evaporating to three quarters of its bulk add a saturated solution of carbonate of potash or soda
1998-15444-0026	boil the finely divided substance with about one eighth its bulk of pure hydrochloric acid add from time to time potassic chloride until the solids are reduced to a straw yellow fluid
1998-15444-0027	the residue of the material after the digestion with hydrochloric acid and potassium chlorate may have to be examined for silver lead and barium
1998-29455-0000	the singing and laughing went on long after he had fallen asleep and if later in the evening there were loud voiced arguments or quarrels even dicky did not hear them
1998-29455-0001	what's all that there dicky asked pointing to the odd knobbly bundles of all sorts and shapes tied on to the pram's front
1998-29455-0002	tell you what mate looks to me as if i took a fancy to you
1998-29455-0003	swab me he said helplessly
1998-29455-0004	oh look said dicky the flowers
1998-29455-0005	they're only weeds said beale
1998-29455-0006	but i shall have them while they are alive said dicky as he had said to the pawnbroker about the moonflowers
1998-29455-0007	hey there's a rabbit
1998-29455-0008	seam cross the road there seam
1998-29455-0009	how beautiful said dicky wriggling with delight
1998-29455-0010	this life of the rabbit as described by mister beale was the child's first glimpse of freedom i'd like to be a rabbit
1998-29455-0011	how am i to weir the room in pram if you goes on like as if you was a beck of fields
1998-29455-0012	i like you next to my own daddy and mister bexton next door
1998-29455-0013	that's all right said mister bee awkwardly
1998-29455-0014	dicky quick to imitate touched his
1998-29455-0015	poor little man said the lady you miss your mother don't you
1998-29455-0016	oh well done little one said mister bee to himself
1998-29455-0017	the two travellers were left facing each other the richer by a penny and oh wonderful good fortune a whole half crown
1998-29455-0018	no i never said dicky here's the steer
1998-29455-0019	you stick to that said belle radiant with delight you're a fair masterpiece you are you earned it honest if ever a kit done
1998-29455-0020	they went on up the hill as happy as anyone need wish to be
1998-29455-0021	please don't be too shocked
1998-29455-0022	remember that neither of them knew any better
1998-29455-0023	to the elder tramp lies and begging were natural means of livelihood
1998-29455-0024	but you said the bed with the green curtains urged dicky
1998-29455-0025	which this end not by no means
1998-29455-0026	the night is full of interesting little sounds that will not at first let you sleep the rustle of little white things in the hedges the barking of dogs in distant farms the chirp of crickets and the croaking of frogs
1998-29455-0027	the new game of begging and inventing stories to interest the people from whom it was worth while to beg went on gaily day by day and week by week and dicky by constant practice grew so clever at taking his part in the acting that mister bee was quite dazed with admiration
1998-29455-0028	blessed if i ever see such a nipper he said over and over again
1998-29455-0029	clever as a train dog is and all that
1998-29455-0030	i ain't sure as i hadn't better stick to the road and keep away from old en's like you jem
1998-29455-0031	i hope he's clever enough to do what he's told keep his mug shut that's all
1998-29455-0032	if he's straight he'll do for me and if he isn't i'll do for him see
1998-29455-0033	see that bloke just now said mister beale yes said dicky
1998-29455-0034	well you never see em
1998-29455-0035	if anyone asked you if you ever see him you never set eyes on him in all your born not to remember him
1998-29455-0036	dicky was full of questions but mister bell had no answers for them
1998-29455-0037	nor was it sunday on which they took a rest and washed their shirts according to mister beil's rule of life
1998-29455-0038	they did not stay there but walked out across the downs where the skylarks were singing and on a dip of the downs came upon great stone walls and towers very strong and grey
1998-29455-0039	what's that there said dicky
7105-2340-0000	with that notorious failing of his he was not the sort of person one wanted in one's house
7105-2340-0001	well the failing still exists doesn't it said the husband or do you suppose a reform of character is entailed along with the estate
7105-2340-0002	besides sincerity a part his being rich will make a difference in the way people will look at his failing
7105-2340-0003	when a man is absolutely wealthy not merely well to do all suspicion of sordid motive natural disappears the thing becomes merely a tiresome malady
7105-2340-0004	wilfred pigeoncoat had suddenly become heir to his uncle sir wilfred pigeoncoat on the death of his cousin major wilfred pigeoncoat who had succumbed to the after effects of apolo accident
7105-2340-0005	a wilfrid pigeoncoat had covered himself with honors in the course of marlborough's campaigns and the name wilfrid had been a young man of about five and twenty who was known more by reputation than by person to a wide circle of cousins and kin
7105-2340-0006	and the reputation was an unpleasant one
7105-2340-0007	from his late school days onward he had been possessed by an acute and obstinate form of cleptomania he had the acquisitive instinct of the collector without any of the collector's discrimination
7105-2340-0008	the search usually produced a large and varied yield this is funny said peter peigan to his wife some half hour after their conversation here's a telegram from wilfred saying he's passing through here in his motor and would like to stop and pay us his respects
7105-2340-0009	signed wilfred pigeon coote
7105-2340-0010	i suppose he's bringing us a present for the silver wedding good gracious
7105-2340-0011	the talk flitted nervously and hurriedly from one impersonal topic to another
7105-2340-0012	in the drawing room after dinner their nervousness and awkwardness increased
7105-2340-0013	oh we haven't shown you the silver wedding presents said missus spender suddenly as though struck by a brilliant idea for entertaining the guest here they all are
7105-2340-0014	such nice useful gifts a few duplicates of course
7105-2340-0015	seven cream jugs put in peter
7105-2340-0016	we feel that we must live on cream for the rest of our lives

7105-2340-0020	after they had said good night to their visitor missus peter expressed her conviction that he had taken something
7105-2340-0021	how on earth are we to know said peter the mean pig hasn't brought us a present and i'm hanged if he shall carry one off
7105-2340-0022	is the only thing to do
7105-2340-0023	wilfred was late in coming down to breakfast and his manner showed plainly that something was amiss
7105-2340-0024	it's an unpleasant thing to have to say he blurted out presently but i'm afraid you must have a thief among your servants something's been taken out of my portmanteau
7105-2340-0025	it was a little present from my mother and myself for your silver wedding
7105-2340-0026	i should have given it to you last night after dinner only it happened to be a cream jug and you seemed annoyed at having so many duplicates so i felt rather awkward about giving you another

7105-2340-0029	husband and wife looked blankly and desperately at one another
7105-2340-0030	it was missus peter who arrived first at an inspiration how dreadful to think there are thieves in the house we keep the drawing room locked up at night of course but anything might be carried off while we are at breakfast
7105-2340-0031	she rose and went out hurriedly as though to assure herself that the drawing room was not being stripped of its silverware and returned a moment later bearing a cream jug in her hands
7105-2340-0032	the pitchforks had turned paler than ever missus peter had a final inspiration
7105-2340-0033	peter dashed out of the room with glad relief he had lived so long during the last few minutes that a golden wedding seemed within measurable distance

7105-2330-0001	he had not only pleaded guilty but had expressed his intention of repeating his escapade in other directions as soon as circumstances permitted throughout the trial he was busy examining a small model of the free trade hall in manchester
7105-2330-0002	the jury could not possibly find that the prisoner had not deliberately and intentionally blown up the albert hall the question was could they find any extenuating circumstances which would permit of an acquittal
7105-2330-0003	of course any sentiment which the law might feel compelled to enforce would be followed by an immediate pardon but it was highly desirable from the government's point of view that the necessity for such an exercise of clemency should not arise
7105-2330-0004	a headlong pardon on the eve of a by election with threats of a heavy voting defection if it were withheld or even delayed would not necessarily be a surrender but it would look like one
7105-2330-0005	hence the anxiety in the crowded court and in the little groups gathered round the type machines in whitehall and downing street and other affected centres
7105-2330-0006	the jury returned from considering their verdict there was a flutter an excited murmur a death like hush

7105-2330-0016	despite the earliness of the hour a small crowd had gathered in the street outside and the horrible menacing three lone refrain of the fifteen hundred voting men came in a steady monotonous chant

7105-2330-0018	he says he never has left prison without a brass band to play him out and he's not going to go without one now
7105-2330-0019	said the prime minister we can hardly be supposed to supply our least prisoner with a brass band how on earth could we defend it on the estimates

7105-2330-0033	have you any band instruments of an easy nature to play
7105-2330-0034	demanded the chief organizer of the present governor drums symbols those sort of things
7105-2330-0035	the warders have a private band of their own said the governor but of course i couldn't allow the men themselves

7105-2330-0041	the local trade unionists took offence at the fact of cabinet ministers having personally acted as strike breakers and even the release of platerbaugh failed to pacify them

2609-156975-0005	the absence of the detailed reference to the hebrews is therefore perfectly natural
2609-156975-0006	it seems probable that not all but only part of the tribes which ultimately colonized into the hebrew nation found their way to egypt
2609-156975-0007	the stories regarding joseph the trading father ephraim and manasseh imply that these strong central tribes possibly together with the southern tribes of benjamin and judah were the chief actors in this opening scene in israel's history
2609-156975-0008	the biblical narratives apparently regarded the diaspora of the jews
2609-156975-0009	the later jurisprudence tended to extend the period

2609-156975-0021	on the borders of the wilderness he found certain bedouin herdsmen who received him hospitably
2609-156975-0022	these sand wanderers sent him one from trim to trim until he reached the land of kedem east of the dead sea where he remained for a year and a half

2609-156975-0030	many modern scholars draw the conclusion from the biblical narrative that it was from the kinite that moses first learned of yahweh or as the distinctive name of israel's god was translated by later jewish grammarians jehovah
2609-156975-0031	do the arabic hebrew traditions imply that the ancestors of the israelites were worshippers of jehovah
2609-156975-0032	the title of his father in law implies that this priest ministered at some workhouse
2609-156975-0033	moses in the home of the median priest was brought into direct and constant contact with the jehovah worship
2609-156975-0034	the cruel fate of his people and the painful experience in egypt that had driven him into the wilderness prepared his mind to receive this training

2609-169640-0005	at that moment i heard a noise when familiar to seamen that of an oar following in the boat
2609-169640-0006	i say ho en close aboard
2609-169640-0007	he was too much of a seaman to require a second look in order to ascertain what was to be done
2609-169640-0008	although they went three feet to our two this gave us a moment of breathing time
2609-169640-0009	as our seats were all flying forward and remained so for a few minutes it gave me a leisure to look about
2609-169640-0010	i soon saw both princes and glad enough was i to perceive that they had not approached materially nearer
2609-169640-0011	miss kite observed this also and remarked that her movements had been so prompt as to take the rascals aback

2609-169640-0014	i heard the rattling of the boarding pieces too as they were cut adrift from the spanker boom and fell upon the decks
2609-169640-0015	kit went aft and returned with three or four muskets and as many pikes
2609-169640-0016	the stillness that reigned on both sides was like that of death
2609-169640-0017	the giant behaved beautifully and came round like a cart
2609-169640-0018	the question was now whether we could pass them or not before they got near enough to grapple
2609-169640-0019	the captain behaved perfectly well in this critical instance commanding a dead silence and the closest attention to his orders
2609-169640-0020	not so on board the john wistar
2609-169640-0021	on our side we gave the gentleman the four sixes two went to the nearest and two went to the sternmost prow which was still near a cable's length distant
2609-169640-0022	they were like the yells of fiends in english
2609-169640-0023	i doubt if we'd tetched the man in the nearest pub

6432-63722-0015	gee exclaimed the colonel
6432-63722-0016	the very pair i was going to buy
6432-63722-0017	look here colonel do you know anything about this
6432-63722-0018	and the detective's professional instincts got the upper hand of his friendliness not the least in the world not as much as you do was the cool answer
6432-63722-0019	i happened to see those candlesticks in the window of singafoot's shop the other day and i made up my mind to buy them when i had a chance
6432-63722-0020	now i'm afraid i won't but how did it happen
6432-63722-0021	futt i don't know whether that's his first or his last name anyhow he had a partner named sherry alee
6432-63722-0022	anyhow he and foot didn't get along very well it seems
6432-63722-0023	neighbors often heard em scrapin a lot and this afternoon they went at it again hot and heavy
6432-63722-0024	toward dark a man went in to buy a lamp
6432-63722-0025	he found the place without a light in it stumbled over something on the floor and there was ali's body with the head bust in and this heavy candlestick near it
6432-63722-0026	sure held so tight we could hardly get it out
6432-63722-0027	maybe the fight was about who owned the watch for the dagoes talked in their foreign lingo and none of the neighbors could tell what they were saying i see
6432-63722-0028	and the watch have you it yes it's here

6432-63722-0030	you're not as screenish as all that are you just because it was in a dead man's hands and a woman's
6432-63722-0031	and donovan's voice was plainly sceptical
6432-63722-0032	yes it may have some rough edges on it
6432-63722-0033	and i've read enough about germs to know the danger i'd advise you to be careful
6432-63722-0034	if you don't mind i should like to examine this a bit
6432-63722-0035	before the big wind in ireland suggested thong with a nod at his irish compatriot slightly he left the colonel
6432-63722-0036	that's right agreed the colonel as he continued to move his magnifying glass over the surface of the still ticking watch
6432-63722-0037	and a close observer might have observed that he did not touch his bare fingers to the time piece but poked it about and touched it here and there with the end of a lead pencil
6432-63722-0038	and dominey take a friend's advice and don't be too free with that watch too free with it
6432-63722-0039	asked the surprised detective yes
6432-63722-0040	don't scratch yourself on it whatever you do why not
6432-63722-0041	simply because this watch
6432-63722-0042	some one out here to see you
6432-63722-0043	all right be there in a second

6432-63722-0045	i want to talk over darcy's case with you the colonel had said and the two had talked had thought had talked again and now were silent for a time
6432-63722-0046	what are the chances of getting him off legally if we go at it from a negative standpoint asked the colonel
6432-63722-0047	rather a hypothetical question colonel but i should say it might be a fifty fifty proposition
6432-63722-0048	at best he would get off with a scotch verdict of not proven but he doesn't want that nor do i
6432-63722-0049	and you i don't want it either
6432-63722-0050	but i want to know just where we stand now i know
6432-63722-0051	but i need to do a little more smoking out first now i want to think
6432-63722-0052	if you'll excuse me i'll pretend i'm fishing and i may catch something
6432-63722-0053	in fact i have a feeling that i'll land my fish
6432-63722-0054	i'd recommend him to you instead of blackstone thanks lapped kenneth
6432-63722-0055	what is it perhaps i can help you
6432-63722-0056	the old adage of two heads you know
6432-63722-0057	yes it still holds good
6432-63722-0058	no aluminum replied the colonel puzzled yes just that
6432-63722-0059	and there's no reason you shouldn't know
6432-63723-0000	chuckled the colonel as he skillfully played the luckless trout now struggling to get loose from the hook
6432-63723-0001	and when the fish was landed panting on the grass and shag had been roused from his slumber to slip the now limp fish into the creel colonel asheley gave a sigh of relief and remarked i think i see it now
6432-63723-0002	the reason she asked no alimony inquired kenneth
6432-63723-0003	no i wasn't thinking of that
6432-63723-0004	however don't think i'm not interested in your case i've finished enough for to day
6432-63723-0005	well i don't know that you can
6432-63723-0006	it isn't generally known went on the lawyer that the hotel keeper's wife has left him
6432-63723-0007	it was one of what at first might be called refined cruelty on her husband's part degenerating gradually into that of a baser sort
6432-63723-0008	you don't mean that larch struck her that there was physical abuse do you asked the colonel that's what he did
6432-63723-0009	the colonel did not disclose the fact that it was no news to him
6432-63723-0010	aaron grafton's statement was being unexpectedly confirmed
6432-63723-0011	he remembered that cynthia and grafton had once been in love with each other
6432-63723-0012	she said he had struck her more than once and she could stand it no longer
6432-63723-0013	because larch made no defence
6432-63723-0014	larch by refusing to appear practically admitted the charges against him and did not oppose the separation
6432-63723-0015	so i had to let her have her way and we did not ask the court for money though i had no such squeamish feelings when it came to my council fee
6432-63723-0016	no but he will or i'll sue em and get judgment oh he'll pay all right
6432-63723-0017	and it takes all sorts of persons to make it up
6432-63723-0018	still i would like to know
6432-63723-0019	the murderer of missus darcy had some time ago been shifted off the front page though it would get back there when the young jeweler was tried
6432-63723-0020	it had a double reputation so to speak
6432-63723-0021	grave and even reverent the conventions assembled in its ballroom and politicians of the upper if not better class were frequently seen in its dining room or cafe
6432-63723-0022	larch himself was a peculiar character
6432-63723-0023	in a smaller place he would have been called a saloon keeper
6432-63723-0024	and it was this man rich it was said handsome certainly that cynthia ratchford had married
6432-63723-0025	to this was the answer whispered money
6432-63723-0026	and in a way it was true
6432-63723-0027	she also saw an opportunity of paying old debts and reaping some revenges
6432-63723-0028	after the marriage which was a brilliant and gay one if not happy the larch hotel it could hardly be called a home became the scene of many festive occasions
6432-63723-0029	then it was said of larch that soon after the echoes of the wedding chimes had died away he had begun to treat his wife with refined cruelty that hidden away from the public underneath his habitual manner there was the rawness of the brute
6432-63723-0030	but it was noticed that the older and more conservative families were less often represented and when they were it was by some of the younger members whose reputations were already smirched or who had not yet acquired any and were willing to take a chance
6432-63723-0031	it wouldn't do you know after that story came out for me and the vice chancellor who sat in the case as well as other judges and members of the bar to be seen there kenneth explained to the colonel
6432-63723-0032	meanwhile colonel ashley was a very busy man and to no one did he tell very much about his activities he saw darcy frequently at the jail and to that young man's pleadings that something be done always returned the answer
6432-63723-0033	don't worry it will come out all right
6432-63723-0034	i'm going to rectify them but it will take time
6432-63723-0035	it's hard for miss mason too although she's bearing up like a major
6432-63723-0036	so king got bale who put it up
6432-63723-0037	it was high large
6432-63723-0038	they took harry away a while ago
6432-63723-0039	but his are pretty uncertain shoes to be in just the same
6432-63723-0040	only that i darcy hesitated and grew red
6432-63723-0041	good evening colonel he called genially will you join me in a welsh rabbit
6432-63723-0042	thank you no
6432-63723-0043	i'm afraid my digestion isn't quite up to that as i've had to cut out my fishing of late
6432-63723-0044	now as to certain matters in the store on the morning of the murder
6432-63723-0045	the stopped clocks for instance have you any theory
6432-63723-0046	there were three of them the centre figure being that of harry king and he was very much intoxicated
6432-63723-0047	that is not always but sometimes it happen to be so now
6432-63723-0048	i beg your pardon he said in the cultured tones he knew so well how to use yet of which he made so little use of late
6432-63723-0049	i said where have you been remarked the other we've missed you
6432-63723-0050	i said i was golfing he went on exceedingly distinctly though with an effort
6432-63723-0051	why polonius some one ask
6432-63723-0052	because dear friend replied king softly he somewhat resembles a certain person here who talks too much but who is not so wise as he thinks
6432-63723-0053	there was a rattle of coins on the mahogany bar as king sought to disentangle a single bill from the wadded up currency in his pocket
6432-63723-0054	it's it's an odd coin an old roman one that missus darcy had in her private collection kept in the jewelry store safe was the whispered answer
6432-63723-0055	i went over them the other day and noticed some were missing though i saw them all when i paid a visit to her just a short time before she was killed
6432-63723-0056	that was hers went on the jeweler
6432-63723-0057	now harry king has it exclaimed colonel ashley
6070-86745-0000	then should anything appear to merit a more minute examination albert de morcerf would follow up his researches by means of a small gate similar to that close to the concierge's door and which merits a particular description
6070-86745-0001	shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows and hid from the garden and court these two apartments the only rooms into which as they were on the ground floor the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate
6070-86745-0002	at a quarter to ten a valet entered he composed with a little room named john and who only spoke english all albert's establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his service and on great occasions the count's chasseur also
6070-86745-0003	wait then during the day tell rosa that when i leave the opera i will sup with her as she wished
6070-86745-0004	very well at half past ten
6070-86745-0005	is the countess up yet
6070-86745-0006	the valet left the room
6070-86745-0007	good morning lucien good morning said albert your punctuality really alarms me
6070-86745-0008	you whom i expected last you arrived at five minutes to ten when the time fixed was half past
6070-86745-0009	no no my dear fellow do not confound our plans
6070-86745-0010	yes he has not much to complain of bourgeois is the capital of charles the seventh
6070-86745-0011	it is for that reason yo see me so early
6070-86745-0012	i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my head ached and i got up to have a ride for an hour
6070-86745-0013	pests i will do nothing of the kind the moment they come from government you would find them exceptionable
6070-86745-0014	besides that does not concern the home but the financial department
6070-86745-0015	about what about the papers
6070-86745-0016	in the entire political world of which you are one of the leaders
6070-86745-0017	they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
6070-86745-0018	come come that is not bad said lucia
6070-86745-0019	with your talents you would make your fortune in three or four years
6070-86744-0000	franz who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the count in which terror was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his friend to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to albert's request but at once accompanied him to the desired spot and after a short delay the count joined them in the salon
6070-86744-0001	my very good friend and excellent neighbour replied the count with a smile you really exaggerate my trifling exertions
6070-86744-0002	my father the comte de morcerf although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the court of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly placed the best services of myself and all to whom my life is dear at your disposal
6070-86744-0003	i can scarcely credit it
6070-86744-0004	then it is settled said the count and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realise plans that i have long meditated
6070-86744-0005	shall we make a positive appointment for a particular day and hour inquired the count only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements day for day hour for hour said albert that will suit me to a dot
6070-86744-0006	so be it then replied the count and extending his hand towards the calendar suspended near the chimney piece he said to day is the twenty first of february and drawing out his watch added it is exactly half past ten o'clock now promise me to remember this and expect me the twenty first of may at the same hour in the forenoon
6070-86744-0007	i reside in my father's house but occupy a pavilion at the farther side of the court yard entirely separated from the main building
6070-86744-0008	now then said the count returning his tablets to his pocket make yourself perfectly easy the hand of your time piece will not be more accurate in marking the time than myself
6070-86744-0009	that depends when do you leave
6070-86744-0010	for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another year or two
6070-86744-0011	then we shall not meet in paris
6070-86744-0012	i fear i shall not have that honour
6070-86744-0013	well since we must part said the count holding out her hand to each of the young men allow me to wish you both a safe and pleasant journey
6070-86744-0014	what is the matter asked albert of france when they had returned to their own apartments you seem more than commonly thoughtful
6070-86744-0015	i will confess to you albert replied franz the count is a very singular person and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
6070-86744-0016	did you ever meet him previously to coming hither
6070-86744-0017	upon my honour then listen to me
6070-86744-0018	he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the count and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and one nights he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the dream and how at his awakening there remained no proof or trace of all these events save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward portovecchio
6070-86744-0019	then he detailed the conversation overheard by him at the coliseum between the count and vampa in which the count had promised to obtain the release of the bandit peppino an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
6070-86744-0020	but said franz the cossack bandits that were among the crew of his vessel
6070-86744-0021	why really the thing seems to me simple enough
6070-86744-0022	talking of countries replied franz of what countries the count what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense fortune and what were those events of his early life a life as marvellous as unknown that have tinted his succeeding years with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy
6070-86744-0023	certainly these are questions that in your place i should like to have answered
6070-86744-0024	my dear franz replied albert when upon receipt of my letter you found the necessity of asking the count's assistance you promptly went to him saying my friend albert de morcerf is in danger help me to deliver him
6070-86744-0025	what are his means of existence what is his birthplace of what country is he a native
6070-86744-0026	i confess he asked me none no he merely came and freed me from the hands of signor vampa where i can assure you in spite of all my outward appearance of ease and unconcern i did not very particularly care to remain
6070-86744-0027	and this time it must be confessed that contrary to the usual state of affairs in discussions between the young men the effective arguments were all on albert's side
6070-86744-0028	well said franz with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my powers of refutation
6070-86744-0029	and now my dear franz let us talk of something else
6070-63485-0000	there done for said the schoolmaster in a low key to the schuette out with your vitriol and mind your eye
6070-63485-0001	the two monsters took off their shoes and moved stealthily along keeping in the shadows of the houses
6070-63485-0002	by means of this stratagem they followed so closely that although within a few steps of sarah and tom they did not hear them
6070-63485-0003	sarah and her brother having again passed by the tappi frank arrived close to the dilapidated house which was partly in ruins and its open cellars formed a kind of gulf along which the street ran in that direction
6070-63485-0004	in an instant the schoolmaster with a leap presuming in strength and agility the spring of a tiger seized seaton with one hand by the throat and exclaimed your money or i will fling you into this hole
6070-63485-0005	no said the old brute grumblingly no not one ring what a shame
6070-63485-0006	tom seaton did not lose his presence of mind during this scene rapidly and unexpectedly as it had occurred
6070-63485-0007	oh ah to lay a trap to catch us replied the thief
6070-63485-0008	then addressing thomas seaton you know the plain of saint denis
6070-63485-0009	did you see in the cabaret we have just left for i know you again the man whom the charcoal man came to seek
6070-63485-0010	cried the schoolmaster a thousand francs and i'll kill him
6070-63485-0011	wretch i do not seek his life replied sarah to the schoolmaster
6070-63485-0012	let's go and meet him
6070-63485-0013	all boy it will be for looking after
6070-63485-0014	well my wife shall be there said the schoolmaster you will tell her what you want and i shall see
6070-63485-0015	in the plain of saint denis
6070-63485-0016	between saint ouen and the road of la revotte at the end of the road agreed
6070-63485-0017	he had forgotten the address of the self styled fan painter
6070-63485-0018	the fiacre started
2414-128292-0000	whither had my loveliness gone spake he
2414-128292-0001	my shadow calleth me
2414-128292-0002	what matter about my shadow
2414-128292-0003	let it run after me i run away from it
2414-128292-0004	thus spake theroute to his heart and ran away
2414-128292-0005	verily my folly had grown big in the mountains
2414-128292-0006	now do i hear six old fool's legs rattling behind one another
2414-128292-0007	but doest thou need to be frightened by his shadow
2414-128292-0008	also methought that after all it had longer legs than mine
2414-128292-0009	for when the duke's scrutinized him with this glance he was frightened as by a sudden apparition so slender swarthy hollow and worn out did his follower appear
2414-128292-0010	at once vehemently what doest thou here
2414-128292-0011	and why callest thou thyself my shadow
2414-128292-0012	thou art not pleasing to me
2414-128292-0013	must i ever be on the way
2414-128292-0014	o art thou hast become too round for me
2414-128292-0015	when the devil casteth his skin doth not his name also fall away it is also skin
2414-128292-0016	the devil himself is perhaps kin
2414-128292-0017	sometimes i meant to lie and behold
2414-128292-0018	then only did i hit the truth
2414-128292-0019	how have i still inclinations
2414-128292-0020	have i still a gold
2414-128292-0021	a haven towards which my sail is set
2414-128292-0022	for it too i ask and seek and have sought but i have not found it
2414-128292-0023	o eternal everywhere o eternal nowhere o eternal in vain
2414-128292-0024	thou art my shadow
2414-128292-0025	said he at last sadly
2414-128292-0026	thy danger is not small thou free spirit and wanderer
2414-128292-0027	they sleep quietly they enjoy their new security
2414-128292-0028	beware lest in the end a narrow faith capture thee a hard relentless delusion
2414-128292-0029	for now everything that is narrow and fixed seduceth and tempteth thee
2414-128292-0030	thou hast lost thy gold
2414-128292-0031	thou poor rover and rambler thou tired butterfly
2414-128292-0032	will thou have a rest and a home this evening
2414-165385-0000	thus accomplished he excited the admiration of every silky cockatoo and the envy of every fluttering pigeon but by all young gentlemen and ladies of understanding he was highly despised as a mere civilized monkey
2414-165385-0001	that his soul might afterwards occupy such a station as would be most suitable to his character it was intended to inhabit the body of that phantom grinning and mischievous little mimic with four legs which you now behold before you
2414-159411-0000	once upon a time a brahmin who was walking along the road came upon an iron cage in which a great tiger had been shut up by the villagers who caught him
2414-159411-0001	the brahmin answered no i will not for if i let you out of the cage you will eat me
2414-159411-0002	o father of mercy answered the tiger in truth that i will not
2414-159411-0003	i will never be so ungrateful only let me out that i may drink some water and return
2414-159411-0004	then the brahmin took pity on him and opened the cage door but no sooner had he turned so than the tiger jumping out said now i'll eat you first and drink the water afterwards
2414-159411-0005	so the brahmin and the tiger walked on till they came to a banana tree and the brahmin said to it banana tree banana tree hear and give juice
2414-159411-0006	on what must i give judgment asked the bennett tree
2414-159411-0007	this tiger said the brahmin begged me to let him out of this cage to drink a little water and he promised not to hurt me if i did so but now that i have left him out he wishes to eat me
2414-159411-0008	it's just that he should do so or no
2414-159411-0009	let the tiger eat the man for men are an ungrateful race
2414-159411-0010	sir camel sir camel cried the brahmin here and give judgment
2414-159411-0011	at a little distance they found a bullock lying by the roadside
2414-159411-0012	is it fair that he should do so or not
2414-159411-0013	let the tiger eat the man for men have no pity
2414-159411-0014	three out of the six had given judgment against the bramins but still he did not lose all hope and determined to ask the other three
2414-159411-0015	on what must i give judgment asked the evil
2414-159411-0016	the brahmin seated the case and the eagle answered whenever men see me they try to shoot me they climb the rocks and steal away my little ones
2414-159411-0017	then the tiger began to roar and said judgment of all is against you o brahmin
2414-159411-0018	after this they saw an alligator and the brahmin related the matter to him hoping for a more favorable verdict
2414-159411-0019	but the alligators said whenever i put my nose out of the water men torment me and try to kill me
2414-159411-0020	the brahman gave himself up as lost but again he prayed the tiger to have patience and let him ask the opinion of the sixth church
2414-159411-0021	not the sixth was a jackal
2414-159411-0022	the bramham told his story and said to him uncle jack uncle jack say what is your judgment
2414-159411-0023	show me the place
2414-159411-0024	when they got there the jackal said now brahmin show me exactly where you stood
2414-159411-0025	exactly there was it asked the jailer
2414-159411-0026	exactly here replied the princess
2414-159411-0027	where was the tiger then
2414-159411-0028	why i stood so said the tiger jumping into the cage and my head was on this side
2414-159411-0029	very good said the jailer but i cannot judge without understanding the whole matter exactly
2414-159411-0030	shut and bolted said de brahm
2414-159411-0031	then shut and bolted said the jackal
2414-159411-0032	when the brahmin had turned this the jackal said oh you wicked and ungrateful tyrant
2414-159411-0033	when a good bramah opened your catechism is to eat him the only return you would make
2414-159411-0034	proceed on your journey friend bramham
2414-159411-0035	your road lies that way and mind this
2414-128291-0000	what hath happened unto me
2414-128291-0001	he asked himself something warm and living quickened me it must be in the neighbourhood
2414-128291-0002	when however the teustra was quite nigh unto them then did he hear plainly the human voice speak in the midst of the kine and apparently all of them had turned their heads towards the speaker
2414-128291-0003	what do i here seek
2414-128291-0004	answered he the same that thou seekest thou mischief maker that is to say happiness upon earth
2414-128291-0005	for i tell thee that i have already talked half a morning unto them and just now were they about to give me their answer
2414-128291-0006	he would not be rid of his affliction
2414-128291-0007	who had not at present his heart his mouth and his eyes full of disgust
2414-128291-0008	thou also thou also
2414-128291-0009	but behold his kin
2414-128291-0010	the kine however gazed at it all and wondered
2414-128291-0011	wanton avidity billious envy careworn revenge populous pride all this struck mine eye
2414-128291-0012	it is no longer true that the poor are blessed
2414-128291-0013	the kingdom of heaven however is with the kin and why is it not with the rich
2414-128291-0014	why thus thou'dst tempt me
2414-128291-0015	and so the other
2414-128291-0016	thou knowest it thyself better even than i
2414-128291-0017	thus spake the peaceful one and puffed himself and purposed with his words that the kind wandered anew
2414-128291-0018	thou doest violence to thyself thou preacher on the mount and thou usest such savour words
2414-128291-0019	they also obtain from all heavy torts which inflame the heart
2414-128291-0020	well
2414-128291-0021	says theaustra thou shouldst also see mine animals mine eagle and my surpint they alike do not at present exist on earth
2414-128291-0022	and talk to mine animals of the happiness of animals
2414-128291-0023	now however take leave at once of thy kin thou strange one
2414-128291-0024	thou amiable one
2414-128291-0025	for they are thy warmest friends and protectors
2414-128291-0026	thou evil flatterer
4350-10919-0000	he perceived that it was no good talking to the old man and that the principal person in the house was the mother
4350-10919-0001	before her he decided to scatter his pearls
4350-10919-0002	the princess was distracted and did not know what to do she felt she had sinned against kitty
4350-10919-0003	well doctor decide our fate said the princess tell me everything
4350-10919-0004	is there hope she meant to say but her lips quivered and she could not utter the question well doctor
4350-10919-0005	as you please the princess went out with a sigh
4350-10919-0006	the family doctor respectfully ceased in the midst of his observations
4350-10919-0007	and there are indications malnutrition nervous excitability and so on
4350-10919-0008	the question stands thus in presence of indications of turbulent process what is to be done to maintain nutrition
4350-10919-0009	yes that's an understood thing responded the celebrated physician again glancing at his watch
4350-10919-0010	beg pardon is the yoskibridge done yet or shall i have to drive around
4350-10919-0011	he asked ah it is
4350-10919-0012	oh well then i can do it in twenty minutes
4350-10919-0013	and how about a tour abroad asked the family doctor
4350-10919-0014	what is wanted is the means of improving nutrition and not for lowering it
4350-10919-0015	the family doctor listened attentively and respectfully
4350-10919-0016	but in favour of foreign travel i would urge the change of habits the removal from conditions calling for premises
4350-10919-0017	and then the mother wishes it he added
4350-10919-0018	ah well in that case to be sure let them go only those german quacks are mischievous
4350-10919-0019	oh time's up already and he went to the door
4350-10919-0020	the celebrated doctor announced to the princess a feeling of what was due from him dictated his doing so that he ought to see the patient once more
4350-10919-0021	oh no only a few details princess come this way
4350-10919-0022	and the mother accompanied by the doctor went into the drawing room to kitty
4350-10919-0023	when the doctor came in she flushed crimson and her eyes filled with tears
4350-10919-0024	she answered him and all at once got up furious
4350-10919-0025	excuse me doctor but there is really no object in this
4350-10919-0026	this is the third time you've asked me the same thing
4350-10919-0027	the celebrated doctor did not take offence
4350-10919-0028	nervous irritability he said to the princess when kitty had left the room however i had finished
4350-10919-0029	and the doctor began scientifically explaining to the princess as an exceptionally intelligent woman the condition of the young princess and concluded by insisting on the drinking of the waters which were certainly harmless
4350-10919-0030	at the question should they go abroad the doctor plunged into deep meditation as though resolving a weighty problem
4350-10919-0031	finally his decision was pronounced they were to go abroad but to put no faith in foreign quacks and to apply to him in any need
4350-10919-0032	it seemed as though some piece of good fortune had come to pass after the doctor had gone
4350-10919-0033	the mother was much more cheerful when she went back to her daughter and kitty pretended to be more cheerful
4350-9170-0000	educated people of the upper classes are trying to stifle the ever growing sense of the necessity of transforming the existing social order
4350-9170-0001	this is absolutely incorrect
4350-9170-0002	in the social conception of life it is supposed that since the aim of life is found in groups of individuals individuals will voluntarily sacrifice their own interests for the interests of the group
4350-9170-0003	the champions of the social conception of life usually try to connect the idea of authority that is of violence with the idea of moral influence but this connection is quite impossible
4350-9170-0004	the man who is controlled by moral influence acts in accordance with his own desires
4350-9170-0005	the basis of authority is bodily violence
4350-9170-0006	the possibility of applying bodily violence to people is provided above all by an organization of armed men trained to act in unison and submission to one will
4350-9170-0007	these bands of armed men submissive to a single will are what constitute the army
4350-9170-0008	the army has always been and still is the basis of power
4350-9170-0009	power is always in the hands of those who control the army and all men in power from the roman caesars to the russian and german emperors take more interest in their army than in anything and court popularity in the army knowing that if that is on their side their power is secure
4350-9170-0010	indeed it could not be otherwise
4350-9170-0011	only under those conditions could the social organization be justified
4350-9170-0012	but since this is not the case and on the contrary men in power are always far from being saints through the very fact of their possession of power the social organization based on power has no justification
4350-9170-0013	even if there was once a time when owing to the low standards of morals and the disposition of men to violence the existence of an authority to restrain such violence was an advantage because the violence of the government was less than the violence of individuals one cannot but see that this advantage could not be lasting
4350-9170-0014	between the members of one state subject to a single authority the strife between the individuals seems still less and the life of the state seems even more secure
4350-9170-0015	it was produced on one hand by the natural growth of population and on the other by struggle and conquest
4350-9170-0016	after conquest the power of the emperor puts an end to internal dissensions and so the state conception of life justifies itself
4350-9170-0017	but this justification is never more than temporary
4350-9170-0018	internal dissensions disappear only in proportion to the degree of oppression exerted by the authority over the dissident individuals
4350-9170-0019	government authority even if it does suppress private violence always introduces into the life of men fresh forms of violence which tend to become greater and greater in proportion to the duration and strength of the government
4350-9170-0020	and therefore the oppression of the oppressed always goes on growing up to the furthest limit beyond which it cannot go without killing the goose with the golden eggs
4350-9170-0021	the most convincing example of this is to be found in the condition of the working classes of our epoch who are in reality no better than the slaves of ancient time subdued by conquest
4350-9170-0022	so it has always been
4350-9170-0023	footnote the fact that in america the hubs of authority exist in spite of the small number of their troops not only fails to disprove this position but positively confirms it
4350-9170-0024	the upper classes know that an army of fifty thousand will soon be insufficient and no longer relying on pinkerton's men they feel that the security of their position depends on the increased strength of the army
4350-9170-0025	the reason to which he gave expression is essentially the same as that which made the french kings and the popes engage swiss and scotch guards and makes the russian authorities of to day so carefully distribute the recruits so that the regiments from the frontiers are stationed in central districts and the regiments from the center are stationed on the frontiers
4350-9170-0026	the meaning of caprivi's speech put into plain language is that funds are needed not to resist foreign foes but to buy under officers to be ready to act against the enslaved toiling masses
4350-9170-0027	and this enormous order of things is maintained by the army
4350-9170-0028	but there is not only one government there are other governments exhibiting their subjects by violence in the same way and are always ready to pounce down on any other government and carry off the fruits of the toil of its enslaved subjects
4350-9170-0029	and so every government needs an army also to protect its booty from its neighbor brigands
4350-9170-0030	this increase is dangerous as montesquieu pointed out a hundred and fifty years ago
4350-9170-0031	every increase in the army of one state with the aim of self defense against its subjects becomes a source of danger for neighboring states and calls for a similar increase in their armies
4350-9170-0032	the despotism of a government always increases with the strength of the army and its external successes and the aggressiveness of a government increases with its internal despotism
4350-9170-0033	the rivalry of the european states in constantly increasing their forces has reduced them to the necessity of having recourse to universal military service since by that means the greatest possible number of soldiers is obtained at the least possible expense
4350-9170-0034	and by this means all citizens are under arms to support the iniquities practised upon them all citizens have become their own oppressors
4350-9170-0035	this inconsistency has become obvious in universal military service
4350-9170-0036	in fact the whole significance of the social conception of life consists in man's recognition of the barbarity of strife between individuals and the transitoriness of personal life itself and the transferrence of the aim of life to groups of persons
4350-9170-0037	but with universal military service it comes to pass that men after making every sacrifice to get rid of the cruelty of strife and the insecurity of existence are called upon to face all the perils they had meant to avoid
4350-9170-0038	but instead of doing that they exposed the individuals to the same necessity of strife substituting strife with individuals of other states for strife with neighbors
4350-9170-0039	the taxes raised from the people for war preparations absorb the greater part of the produce of labor which the army ought to defend
4350-9170-0040	the danger of war ever ready to break out renders all reforms of life social life vain and fruitless
4350-9170-0041	but the fatal significance of universal military service as the manifestation of the contradiction inherent in the social conception of life is not only apparent in that
4350-9170-0042	governments assert that armies are needed above all for external defense but that is not true
4350-9170-0043	they are needed principally against their subjects and every man under universal military service becomes an accomplice in all the acts of violence of the government against the citizens without any choice of his own
4350-9170-0044	and for the sake of what am i making them
4350-9170-0045	i'm expected for the sake of the state to make these sacrifices to renounce everything that can be precious to man peace family security and human dignity
4350-9170-0046	except for the state they say we should be exposed to the attacks of evil disposed persons in our own country
4350-9170-0047	we now know that threats and punishments cannot diminish their number that that can only be done by change of environment and moral influence
4350-9170-0048	so that the justification of state violence on the ground of the protection it gives us from evil disposed persons even if it had some foundation three or four centuries ago has none whatever now
4350-9170-0049	except for the state they tell us we should not have any religion education culture means of communication and so on
4350-9170-0050	without the state men would not have been able to form the social institutions needed for doing anything
4350-9170-0051	this argument too was well founded only some centuries ago
4350-9170-0052	the great extension of means of communication and interchange of ideas has made men completely able to dispense with state aid in forming societies associations corporations and congresses for scientific economic and political objects
4350-9170-0053	without government's nations would be enslaved by their neighbours
4350-9170-0054	the government they tell us with its army is necessary to defend us from neighboring states who might enslave us
4350-9170-0055	and if defence against barbarous nations is meant one thousandth part of the troops now under arms would be amply sufficient for that purpose
4350-9170-0056	the power of the state far from being a security against the attacks of our neighbours exposes us on the contrary to much greater danger of such attacks
4350-9170-0057	even looking at it practically weighing that is to say all the burdens laid on him by the state no man can fail to see that for him personally to comply with the state demands and serve in the army would in the majority of cases be more disadvantageous than to refuse to do so
4350-9170-0058	to resist would need independent thought and effort of which every man is not capable
4350-9170-0059	so much for the advantages and disadvantages of both lines of conduct for a man of the wealthy class an oppressor
4350-9170-0060	for a man of the poor working class the advantages and disadvantages will be the same but with a great increase of disadvantages
8188-274364-0000	the commons also voted that the new created peers ought to have no voice in this trial because the accusation being agreed to while they were commons their consent to it was implied with that of all the commons of england
8188-274364-0001	in the government of ireland his administration had been equally promotive of his master's interest and that of the subjects committed to his care
8188-274364-0002	the case of lord montagu norris of all those which were collected with so much industry is the most flagrant and the least excusable
8188-274364-0003	the court which consisted of the chief officials of the army found the crime to be capital and condemned that nobleman to lose his head
8188-274364-0004	where the token by which i shall discover it
8188-274364-0005	it is now a full two hundred and forty years since treasons were defined and so long has it been since any man was touched to this extent upon this crime before myself
8188-274364-0006	let us not to our own destruction awake those sleeping lions by rattling up a company of old records which have lain for so many ages by the wall forgotten and neglected
8188-274364-0007	however these gentlemen at the bar say they speak for the commonwealth and they believe so yet under favour it is i who in this particular speak for the commonwealth
8188-274364-0008	my lords i have now troubled your lordships a great deal longer than i should have done
8188-274364-0009	young vane falling upon this paper of notes deemed the matter of the utmost importance and immediately communicated it to pym who now produced the paper before the house of commons
8188-274364-0010	the king proposes this difficulty but how can i undertake effective war if i have no more money
8188-274364-0011	your government having tried the affections of your people you are absolved and loosed from all rules of government and may do what power will admit
8188-269290-0000	the gilt of saint elizabeth
8188-269290-0001	immediately after dinner that evening leslie ran up to her room to make preparations for her visit to east hall
8188-269290-0002	i'm not coming said any
8188-269290-0003	every student is to be in east hall at half past eight
8188-269290-0004	it doesn't matter replied enny whether it is an order or not i'm not coming say nothing about me please
8188-269290-0005	it burned as if with fever
8188-269290-0006	you don't know what a trial it is for me to have you here
8188-269290-0007	i want to be alone go
8188-269290-0008	i know you don't quite mean what you say said lizzie but of course if you really wish me
8188-269290-0009	you fretted me beyond endurance
8188-269290-0010	wrapping a pretty blue shawl around her head and shoulders she turned to annie
8188-269290-0011	lizzie was just closing the door behind her when enny called after her
8188-269290-0012	i took it out said lizzie took it out
8188-269290-0013	have the goodness to find it and put it back
8188-269290-0014	but don't lock me out please any
8188-269290-0015	oh i won't look you out she said but i must have the key
8188-269290-0016	jane heyward's voice was heard in the passage
8188-269290-0017	as she walked down the corridor she heard it being turned in the lock
8188-269290-0018	what can this mean she said to herself
8188-269290-0019	oh i won't press you replied jane
8188-269290-0020	oh i shall never do that replied lisle
8188-269290-0021	you see all the girls except eileen and marjorie laugh at her and that seems to me to make her worse
8188-269290-0022	some day jane you must see her
8188-269290-0023	if you're in london during the summer you must come and pay us a visit will you
8188-269290-0024	that is if you cared to confide in me
8188-269290-0025	i believe poor annie is dreadfully unhappy
8188-269290-0026	that's just it jane that is what brightens me she refuses to come
8188-269290-0027	refuses to come she cried
8188-269290-0028	she'll get in her awful scrape
8188-269290-0029	i am sure she is ill she works too hard and she but there i don't know that i ought to say any more
8188-269290-0030	i'll wait for you here said lisle
8188-269290-0031	do come any do
8188-269290-0032	scarcely likely replied leslie she told me she was determined not to come to the meeting
8188-269290-0033	but margery and ida lee had already departed and lizzie and jane found themselves among the last students to arrive at the great east hall
8188-269290-0034	miss lord dalhousie was standing with the other tutors and principals of the different halls on a raised platform
8188-269290-0035	then a roll call was gone through by one of the tutors the only absentee was any colchester
8188-269290-0036	the physical part of your training and also the mental part are abundantly supplied in this great house of learning she continued but the spiritual part it seems to me ought now to be strengthened
8188-269290-0037	here here and once again here
8188-269290-0038	she uttered her strainermark standing up
8188-269290-0039	marjorie and ilene were close to her
8188-269290-0040	i will talk with you bell archer presently she said
8188-269290-0041	the names of the proposed members are to be submitted to me before this day week
8188-269290-0042	am i my brother's keeper
8188-269290-0043	you ask she continued
8188-269290-0044	god answers to each of you you are
8188-269290-0045	the world says no i am not but god says yes you are
8188-269290-0046	all men are your brothers
8188-269290-0047	for all who sin all who suffer you are to a certain extent responsible
8188-269290-0048	after the address the girls themselves were encouraged to speak and a very animated discussion followed
8188-269290-0049	it was past ten o'clock when she left the hall
8188-269290-0050	just as she was doing so miss frere came up
8188-269290-0051	any colchester is your room fellow is he not she said
8188-269290-0052	i see by your face miss gilroy that you are distressed about something are you keeping anything back
8188-269290-0053	i am afraid i am replied lizzie distressed now in her tone
8188-269290-0054	i must see her myself early in the morning and i'm quite sure that nothing will satisfy miss lord dalhousie except a very ample apology and a full explanation of the reason why she absented herself
8188-269290-0055	excuses make no difference
8188-269290-0056	the girl who breaks the rules has to be punished
8188-269290-0057	i will tell her
8188-269288-0000	anny colchester had begun to make friends with lisle
8188-269288-0001	leslie determined to try for honors in english language and literature
8188-269288-0002	her tastes all lay in this direction her idea being by and by to follow her mother's profession of generalism for which she already showed considerable aptitude
8188-269288-0003	she had no idea of allowing herself to break down
8188-269288-0004	what do you mean replied leslie
8188-269288-0005	why you will be parting from me you know
8188-269288-0006	i won't be the constant worry and plague of your life
8188-269288-0007	it is this if by any chance you don't leave saint wards any i hope you will allow me to be your room fellow again next term
8188-269288-0008	said annie a flash of light coming into her eyes and then leaving them
8188-269288-0009	but she added abruptly you speak of something which must not take place
8188-269288-0010	i must pass on honours if i don't i shall die
8188-269288-0011	a few moments later there came a tap at the door
8188-269288-0012	lisle opened the door
8188-269288-0013	jane hiram stood without
8188-269288-0014	these letters have just come for you and annie colchester she said and as i was coming upstairs i thought i would leave them with you
8188-269288-0015	leslie thanked her and eagerly grasped the little parcel
8188-269288-0016	her eyes shone with pleasure at the anticipation of the delightful time she would have reveling in the home news the other letter was directed to any colchester
8188-269288-0017	here is the letter for you annie cried lizzie
8188-269288-0018	her face grew suddenly white as death what is it dear
8188-269288-0019	i have been starving or rather i have been thirsting
8188-269288-0020	well read it in peace said leadsley i won't disturb you
8188-269288-0021	i am truly glad it has come
8188-269288-0022	lesly seated herself with her back to her companion and opened her own letters
8188-269288-0023	don't notice me replied ennis
8188-269288-0024	i must go into the grounds the air is stifling
8188-269288-0025	but they are just shutting up
8188-269288-0026	i shall go i know a way
8188-269288-0027	just after midnight she rose with a sigh to prepare for bed
8188-269288-0028	she looked round the room
8188-269288-0029	now i remember she got a letter which upset her very much and went out
8188-269288-0030	leslie went to the window and flung it open she put her head out and tried to peer into the darkness but the moon had already set and she could not see more than a couple of yards in front of her
8188-269288-0031	she is a very queer erratic creature and that letter there was bad news in that letter
8188-269288-0032	what can she be doing out by herself
8188-269288-0033	lizzie left the room but she had scarcely gone a dozen places down the corridor before she met any returning
8188-269288-0034	annie's eyes were very bright her cheeks were no longer pale and there was a brilliant color in them
8188-269288-0035	she did not take the least notice of leslie but going into the room shut the door
8188-269288-0036	don't begin said annie
8188-269288-0037	don't begin what do you mean
8188-269288-0038	i mean that i don't want you to begin to ask questions
8188-269288-0039	i walked up and down as fast as ever i could outside in order to make myself sleepy
8188-269288-0040	don't talk to me lizzie don't say a single word
8188-269288-0041	i shall go off to sleep that is all i care for
8188-269288-0042	don't said any
8188-269288-0043	now drink this at once she said in a voice of authority if you really wish to sleep
8188-269288-0044	enny stared vacantly at the coco then she uttered a laugh
8188-269288-0045	drink that she said
8188-269288-0046	do you want to kill me don't talk any more
8188-269288-0047	i am sleepy i shall sleep
8188-269288-0048	she got into bed as she spoke and wrapped the clothes tightly round her
8188-269288-0049	can you manage with a candle just for once
8188-269288-0050	certainly said rayeley
8188-269288-0051	she turned off the light and lit a candle which she put behind her screen then appeared to get into bed
8188-269288-0052	enny's manner was very mysterious
8188-269288-0053	anny did not mean to confine anyone that night and the kindest thing was to leave her alone
8188-269288-0054	tired out lizzie herself dropped asleep
8188-269288-0055	anny is that you she called out
8188-269288-0056	there was no reply but the sound of hurrying steps came quicker and quicker now and then they were interrupted by a groan
8188-269288-0057	oh this will kill me my heart will break this will kill me
