child_0000-00002 AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD EVENING EVERYBODY AND A WARM WELCOME TO OUR NEXT PRESENTATION MY NAME IS KATHARINA MORLANG AND TOGETHER WITH MY COLLEAGUES HIKER HOODS AND PATRICK YOUNG PLEASE GIVE ME YOUR HANDS
child_0000-00013 UM WILL NOW EXPLAIN TO US THE CONCEPT OF PERSONALITY IN TEAM DEVELOPMENT IN SPORT WHICH CLEARLY USES THE SPORT ITSELF AND TARGETS METHODS IN SPORT TO DEVELOP THE TEAM MAKE THE TEAM AND THE ATHLETE MORE SUCCESSFUL
child_0000-00026 NOW I HAVE TO GO TO MY PRESENTATION THAT IT RUNS
child_0000-00041 A PRESENTATION AT A FORUM FOR YOUTH SPORTS IN TWO THOUSAND ONE BECAME THE STARTING POINT FOR A LONGSTANDING INTERACTIVE KNOWLEDGE EXCHANGE BETWEEN SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
child_0000-00057 IT QUICKLY BECAME CLEAR THAT THIS REQUIRES NOT ONLY CONDITIONAL MOTOR OR TACTICAL RESOURCES BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE SELF CONFIDENCE AND ABILITY TO COOPERATE COHESION AND CONCENTRATION IN OTHER WORDS
child_0000-00071 WE CALL THESE OUTCOMES FOR THE PSYCHOSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT KEY TARGET
child_0000-00087 THE ATHLETICS SELF CONFIDENCE OR IN ALSO INCLUDES THE INDIVIDUAL'S CONVICTION THAT HE CAN APPLY THE SPORTING SKILLS SUCCESSFULLY ALSO IN CHALLENGING SITUATION
child_0000-00103 COACHES CAN PICK UP THESE SITUATIONS AND USE THEM FOR THE PROMOTION OF SELF CONFIDENCE FOR EXAMPLE IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE IF COACHES EVALUATE THE SUCCESS OF THE TEAM BASED JUST ON THE WIN OR LOSS OF THE GAME
child_0000-00004 YES AND WE REPRESENT UH THE GERMAN SPORTS YOUTH AND UM TOGETHER WE DRIVE THE PROJECT I COACH KIDS FORWARD GERMANY
child_0000-00014 MARTIN UM IF YOU WANT AND IF YOU ARE READY YOU CAN START NOW AND WE WILL DISCUSS LATER
child_0000-00028 BETTER NOW IF I SAY WE HAVE UNIQUE FRAMEWORK I SHOULD EXPLAIN TO WHICH EXTENT OUR FRAMEWORK IS UNIQUE THERE ARE FIVE POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO DISCUSS IN MORE DETAIL TODAY
child_0000-00043 DURING THE FOLLOWING YEARS THE INITIAL FRAMEWORK WAS ADAPTED TO FIVE SPORTS
child_0000-00058 RESOURCES THAT LIE IN THE PSYCHOSOCIAL AREA
child_0000-00073 ALSO TOGETHER WITH THE EXPERTS FROM THE SELECTED SPORTS WE CONSIDERED WHICH SPORT SPECIFIC METHODS AIM AT THESE KEY TARGETS OR RESPECTIVELY HOW THE KEY TARGETS CAN BE ACHIEVED IN EVERYDAY TRAINING
child_0000-00089 THE ATHLETICS SELF CONFIDENCE IS INFLUENCED BY EXPERIENCE OF SUCCESS AND FAILURE BY DIRECT AND INDIRECT FEEDBACK AND MUST HAVE COMPARISONS
child_0000-00104 OR IF THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ATHLETES REGARDLESS OF THE GAME'S RESULT
child_0000-00005 THE GERMAN SPORTS YOUTH REPRESENTS ALL YOUTH SPORTS ORGANIZATIONS IN GERMANY AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO BE A PARTNER OF THE FOLLOW UP PROJECT I COACH KIDS CLASS
child_0000-00016 YES I'M READY AND UH I THANK YOU KATHARINA FOR THE FRIENDLY INTRODUCTION AND ALSO YOUR REFERENCE TO OUR LONGSTANDING COOPERATION IN THE FIELD OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH SPORTS
child_0000-00030 FIRST
child_0000-00045 ADDITIONALLY THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WAS SCIENTIFICALLY EVALUATED IN THE SPORTS OF HANDBALL AND ARTISTIC GYMNASTICS THIS EVALUATION STUDY WAS CONDUCTED BY OUR ESTEEMED COLLEAGUE KRISTEN HAMMON AND PROFESSOR RAZUGO
child_0000-00060 PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCE ALSO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PREVENTION OF DROPOUT SEVERAL STUDIES AND ALSO THE PRESENTATION OF KATHERINE WOODS TODAY
child_0000-00075 ALL MEASURES FOR THE PROMOTION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE INTERCONNECTED AREA
child_0000-00091 BUT TO WHICH OUTCOME SHOULD THE ATHLETIC SELF CONFIDENCE BE PROMOTED
child_0000-00106 OFTEN A HARD ONE NARROW DEFEAT IS BASED ON A BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN A CLEAR VICTORY
child_0000-00006 FOR THIS REASON WE ARE ALSO PARTICIPATING IN THIS HUGE CONFERENCE AND WE ARE HAPPY TO BE PART OF IT
child_0000-00018 A POSITIVE REALISTIC SELF CONFIDENCE OF THE ATHLETES AND A GOOD TASK COHESION WITHIN THE TRAINING GROUP CONTRIBUTES TO A LONG LASTING ATTACHMENT OF ATHLETES AND SPORTS THAT'S WHY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE PROMOTION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES WITH YOU TODAY
child_0000-00032 OUR FRAMEWORK TAKE A CLOSE LOOK WHICH PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES CHILDREN NEED TO SOLVE THE REQUIREMENTS OF DIFFERENT SPORTS
child_0000-00047 IN ALL THIS PROJECT WE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL SCIENTIFIC IDEA WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS SUMMARIZED IN THE NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PERSONALITY AND TEAM DEVELOPMENT SPORT
child_0000-00061 INDICATE THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT ATHLETES WILL MAINTAIN THEIR ACTIVITY IF THEY HAVE A POSITIVE REALISTIC SELF CONFIDENCE AND IF THEY ARE WELL INTEGRATED INTO A TRAINING GROUP
child_0000-00077 IN THE GREEN AREA WE DESCRIBE METHODS FOR THE PLANNING OF EVERYDAY TRAINING LIKE PICKING UP CURRENT EXPERIENCES OR ARRANGING SPECIAL EXERCISES FOR THE PROMOTION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES
child_0000-00093 SUCCESSFUL ATHLETES ARE USUALLY CHARACTERIZED BY THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A REALISTIC SELF CONCEPT AND A POSITIVE EXPECTATION OF THEIR SELF EFFICACY IN OTHER WORDS
child_0000-00108 HERE COULD COACHES SHOULD BASE THEIR FEEDBACK ON THE ACTUAL SHOWN PERFORMANCE
child_0000-00008 THE GERMAN SPORTS YOUTH DEVELOPED TOGETHER WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF ERLANGAN AND BAVARIA A CONCEPT FOR DEVELOPING THE PERSONALITY AND THE TEAM IN SPORTS
child_0000-00020 THEIR COLLEAGUES AND THEIR COACHES IN THE FIELD OF CHILDREN AND YOUTH SPORTS THANK YOU FOR JOINING MY PRESENTATION TODAY THE TOPIC OF MY PRESENTATION IS PREVENTING DROPOUT THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES FOR THAT
child_0000-00034 SECOND THE FRAMEWORK ENABLES THE PROMOTION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES WHICH ARE HELPFUL FOR THE PREVENTION OF DROPOUT
child_0000-00049 ON MATTER I PRESENT TODAY REFER TO THIS NEW CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
child_0000-00063 DUE TO THIS RELATIONSHIP I WILL PRESENT THE STRUCTURE AND THE MEASURES OF ALL CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK BY USING EXAMPLES FOR THE PROMOTION OF SELF CONFIDENCE AND TASK COHESION
child_0000-00079 IN THE RED AREA WE DESCRIBE PRINCIPLES FOR SHAPING THE COACH ATHLETE RELATIONSHIP AND IN THE YELLOW AREA WE DESCRIBE PRINCIPLES FOR INFLUENCING THE ATHLETE ATHLETE RELATIONSHIP
child_0000-00095 THE ATHLETE KNOWS ABOUT HIS SKILLS TO CONTROL THE SEVEN METER THROW IN ADDITION HE IS CONFIDENT THAT HE CAN MASTER THE SEVEN METER THROW EVEN SHORT BEFORE THE END OF THE GAME IN CASE OF A TIE
child_0000-00110 IN ADDITION TO THESE EXISTING SITUATIONS THAT ARE SPECIFIC EXERCISES TO ARRANGE SITUATIONS IN WHICH ATHLETES DEAL WITH THEIR ATHLETIC ABILITIES ONE SUITABLE EXERCISE FOR THE PROMOTION OF SELF CONFIDENCE IS THE ACCOMPANYING SELF ASSESSMENT
child_0000-00009 FOR THE PAST FIVE YEARS UM WE ALSO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTING COACHES IN GERMANY ESPECIALLY TOGETHER WITH THE GERMAN OLYMPIC SPORTS FEDERATION
child_0000-00021 I DO NOT ONLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE INTERCONNECTION BETWEEN PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES
child_0000-00036 THIRD THE FRAMEWORK HAS A SYSTEMATIC APPROACH WITH TARGETS AND SUITABLE MEASURES TO REACH THIS TARGET
child_0000-00051 WHEN DEVELOPING THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK THE GUIDING QUESTION WAS WHAT RESOURCES DO CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE NEED IN ORDER
child_0000-00065 FOR THE PROMOTION OF SELF CONFIDENCE COHESION AND FOR MORE TARGETS WE USE THE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO DESCRIBE RESOURCES DEVELOP TARGETS AND CHOOSE APPROPRIATE MEASURES
child_0000-00081 NOW LET'S HAVE A CLOSE LOOK AT THE EXAMPLES OF THE RESOURCES TARGETS AND MEASURES STARTING WITH A PROMOTION OF ATHLETIC SELF CONFIDENCE
child_0000-00097 THEREFORE WE HAVE CHOSEN THE KEY TARGET THE ATHLETE POSSESSED A POSITIVE REALISTIC SELF CONFIDENCE OF HIS SPORTING SKILLS
child_0000-00112 BEFORE AND AFTER TRAINING A SESSION THE ATHLETE ARE ASKED TO GIVE THEMSELVES A GRADE FOR HOW THEY MASTER A SPECIAL TECHNIQUE
child_0000-00010 WE WANT THAT UM COACHES IN GERMANY UM RECEIVE A GOOD EDUCATION THEIR CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE RECEIVE THE BEST POSSIBLE SUPPORT OF THEIR COACHES AND THAT THEY CAN GROW UP HEALTHY AND ARE MADE STRONG FOR LIFE
child_0000-00022 UH AND DROP OUT FROM A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE RATHER I WANT TO PRESS PRESENT SPECIFIC MEASURES FOR THE PROMOTION OF THOSE PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE PREVENTION OF DROPOUT
child_0000-00038 THE SPECIFIC MEASURES ARE SUITABLE FOR EVERYDAY TRAINING AND THE FRAMEWORK GREW OVER YEARS FROM SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL EVIDENCE AND FOR PRACTICABLE FEASIBILITY
child_0000-00053 TO LEARN EFFECTIVELY IN SPORTS
child_0000-00067 TO THIS END WE HAVE TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK WHAT SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE TELLS US ABOUT THESE PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES
child_0000-00083 IF ATHLETICS SELF CONFIDENCE CONTRIBUTES TO STAY ATTACHED IN SPORTS WE SHOULD CONSIDER WHAT CONSTITUTES ATHLETICS SELF CONFIDENCE TO WHICH OUTCOME WE WANT TO PROMOTE IT AND HOW WE CAN PROMOTE IT
child_0000-00099 AND HOW CAN ATHLETICS SELF CONFIDENCE BE PROMOTED IN EVERYDAY TRAINING
child_0000-00114 LET US GO BACK TO THE EXAMPLE OF THE SEVEN METER THROW THERE ARE SEVERAL TECHNIQUES TO MASTER A SEVEN METER THROW AND HAND BALL PLAYERS PRACTICE THESE TECHNIQUES FREQUENTLY
child_0000-00012 MARTIN MUCHEM RESEARCH ASSISTANT AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ERLANGEN AN IMPORTANT KEY PARTNER FOR US
child_0000-00024 A WIDE RANGE OF THESE MEASURES IS COLLECTED NOW UNIQUE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PERSONALITY AND TEAM DEVELOPMENT IN SPORT WHICH KATHARINA ALSO MENTIONED BEFORE
child_0000-00040 THE FIRST CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK WAS CALLED PROMOTION OF PSYCHOSOCIAL RESOURCES AND WAS DEVELOPED BY PROFESSOR RAZUGO
child_0000-00055 TO PERFORM OPTIMALLY AND TO STAY ATTACHED TO THE SPORT IN THE LONG TERM
child_0000-00069 WE DISCUSSED WITH EXPERTS FROM SELECTED SPORTS WHICH RESOURCES ARE IMPORTANT IN THEIR SPORT AND TO WHICH OUTCOME THESE RESOURCES SHOULD BE PROMOTED
child_0000-00085 THE ATHLETICS SELF CONFIDENCE INCLUDES ALL THE ASSUMPTIONS A PERSON MAKES ABOUT HIS OR HER OWN SPORTING SKILLS
child_0000-00101 TRAINING COMPETITION OF A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS THAT HAVE AN EFFECT ON ATHLETIC SELF CONFIDENCE
child_0000-00116 BEFORE A TRAINING SESSION FOR THE SEVEN METER THROW THE ATHLETE RATES THE ABILITY TO SHOW TECHNIQUES LIKE SHOOTING STRAIGHT SHOOTING THE ROTATION OF THE BALL SHOOTING WITH A BOUNCE OFF THE GROUND OR SHOOTING A LOT
