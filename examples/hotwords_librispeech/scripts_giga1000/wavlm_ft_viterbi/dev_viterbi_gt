POD1000000004_S0000042	AND AMERICANS RETURNED TO THE WARM EMBRACE OF THEIR BOXED MAC AND CHEESE AND TAKEOUT PAD THAI OBVIOUSLY A HOME-COOKING REVOLUTION DIDN'T MATERIALIZE 
POD1000000004_S0000043	OR DID IT THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS HAS FORCED MANY OF US TO BECOME INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH OUR CASSEROLE DISHES AND OUR GARLIC PRESSES AND OUR DUTCH OVENS 
POD1000000004_S0000044	WE MADE BANANA BREAD BY THE PALLET AND SOURDOUGH STARTER BY THE TON WE LEARNED HOW TO SEAR STEAKS AND SPATCHCOCK CHICKENS AND ALL MANNER OF GRUESOME CARNIVOROUS TECHNIQUES IN SHORT BOY DID WE EVER COOK 
POD1000000004_S0000045	ALL THIS COOKING AT HOME CREATED A MAKER BREAK MOMENT FOR BLUE APRON BUT IT WASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE LIKE THAT JUST A FEW YEARS AGO THE COMPANY WAS VALUED AT TWO BILLION DOLLARS NOW IT WAS BARELY HANGING ON BY ITS FINGERNAILS 
POD1000000004_S0000046	IT'S ONLY LIFELINE A GLOBAL HEALTH CRISIS SO REQUIRED SO MANY OF US TO SHELTER IN PLACE FOR MONTHS AND AVOID TRIPS TO THE GROCERY STORE 
POD1000000004_S0000047	I'M LAUREN OBER AND FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA WELCOME TO THE NEW SEASONS OF SPECTACULAR FAILURES THE SHOW THAT ALWAYS FLAMBEES THE HELL OUT OF FAILURE 
POD1000000004_S0000049	LEGEND HAS IT THAT THE IDEA FOR BLUE APRON BEGAN WITH AN ARGENTINIAN STEAK THERE WERE THESE TWO GUYS MATT SALZBERG AND ILIA PAPAS THEY WERE CLEVER TECH ENTREPRENEUR TYPES 
POD1000000004_S0000050	FULL OF IDEAS SALZBERG HAD AN M B A FROM HARVARD AND CUT HIS TEETH IN A BIG NEW YORK VENTURE CAPITAL FIRM PAPAS WAS A GO-GETTER SOFTWARE ENGINEER THEY MET AT A NETWORK-Y HAPPY HOUR AND DECIDED TO GO INTO BUSINESS TOGETHER 
POD1000000004_S0000051	BUT WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS 
POD1000000004_S0000052	THEIR ORIGINAL IDEA IS NOT MEAL KITS IT IS MORE OF A RESEARCH CROWD FUNDING IDEA CALLED PETRI DISH 
POD1000000004_S0000053	THAT'S ALEX KONRAD HE'S A SENIOR EDITOR AT FORBES HE WROTE ABOUT THE FOUNDERS IN TWENTY-FIFTEEN PETRI DISH WASN'T THE PAIR'S ONLY STARTUP IDEA 
POD1000000004_S0000054	I THINK ANOTHER ONE WE HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR ARTICLE WAS WARBY PARKER FOR STROLLERS 
POD1000000004_S0000055	I DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND 
POD1000000004_S0000057	A HIGH END BUT ALSO AFFORDABLE STROLLER EXPERIENCE UM YEAH 
POD1000000004_S0000058	SO THOSE TWO STARTUP IDEAS A KICKSTARTER FOR SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS AND A WARBY PARKER FOR STROLLERS WERE NONSTARTERS FOR THE PAIR BUT THEN OVER GRILLED MEAT IT HIT THEM 
POD1000000004_S0000059	SALZBERG AND PAPAS ARE DOING DINNER AND THEY'RE STRUGGLING TO AH MAKE ARGENTINIAN AH STEAKS ON A BORROWED GRILL 
POD1000000004_S0000060	AND THEY'RE LIKE YOU KNOW WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF THERE'S A SERVICE BASICALLY FOR AMATEURS LIKE US 
POD1000000004_S0000061	IN FACT THERE WAS BUT IT WAS IN SWEDEN IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN A WOMAN NAMED KICKI THEANDER CREATED A COMPANY CALLED 
POD1000000004_S0000062	MIDDAGSFRID THAT TRANSLATES INTO DINNER PEACE IN ENGLISH 
POD1000000004_S0000063	LET ME SEE IF I CAN PRONOUNCE THIS RIGHT MIDDAGSFRID 
POD1000000004_S0000064	DA THAT'S PRETTY GOOD 
POD1000000004_S0000065	THEANDER WANTED TO SOLVE THE VEXING NIGHTLY PROBLEM THAT FAMILIES AROUND THE WORLD FACE WHAT ARE WE HAVING FOR DINNER BECAUSE THE ANSWER CAN'T ALWAYS BE ICE CREAM 
POD1000000004_S0000066	PEOPLE STARTED TALKING ABOUT HELL HOUR HUM YOU KNOW LIKE THE HOUR BETWEEN FIVE AND SIX WHEN YOU HAVE TO RUN TO THE GROCERY STORE AND AH FIGHT WITH YOUR SPOUSE ABOUT WHO'S COOKING TONIGHT WHAT ARE WE HAVING 
POD1000000004_S0000067	THAT RIGHT THERE IS THE SPIRIT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP 
POD1000000004_S0000068	I THINK THE QUESTION IS THEN IS THIS A LEGITIMATELY HUGE PROBLEM AND IS THIS A PROBLEM THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAD AS WELL 
POD1000000004_S0000069	FOR SALZBERG AND PAPAS THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF THOSE QUESTIONS WAS AN ENTHUSIASTIC YES NOW AT THIS POINT IT WAS TWENTY-TWELVE AND THEANDER'S COMPANY HAD BEEN AROUND FOR FIVE YEARS AND WAS GROWING STEADILY 
POD1000000004_S0000070	IT HAD A FEW COMPETITORS IN EUROPE BUT IN THE U S NOTHING OF THE SORT EXISTED WHICH WAS GREAT FOR SALZBERG AND PAPAS 
POD1000000004_S0000071	AND SO THEY THINK HEY WE CAN START OUR OWN MEAL KIT COMPANY FOR THE U S MARKET CALLED PART AND PARSLEY 
POD1000000004_S0000072	TO BE CLEAR THAT'S A TERRIBLE NAME AND VERY QUICKLY THEY CHANGED IT TO BLUE APRON NAMED FOR WHAT FRENCH APPRENTICE CHEFS WEAR IN THE KITCHEN 
POD1000000004_S0000073	AT ALMOST THE EXACT SAME TIME A HARVARD CLASSMATE OF SALZBERG'S BEGAN A RIVAL MEAL KIT COMPANY CALLED PLATED BUT SALZBERG AND PAPAS WEREN'T WORRIED BECAUSE THEY HAD BROUGHT ON A RINGER 
POD1000000004_S0000074	MATT WADIAK A CHEF WITH A DEGREE FROM THE PRESTIGIOUS CULINARY INSTITUTE OF AMERICA AND WADIAK WAS THE GUY THAT WAS GONNA MAKE THEIR BUSINESS STAND APART FROM ITS RIVALS 
POD1000000004_S0000075	WADIAK WOULD BASICALLY GO AND SOURCE THE INGREDIENTS FARMERS WOULD SAY OKAY WE WOULD LOVE TO LOCK IN THESE LARGE EXTRA ORDERS 
POD1000000004_S0000076	AT A SCALE THAT IS VERY UM ATTRACTIVE TO US YOU KNOW MANY THOUSANDS OF INGREDIENTS I THINK YOU KNOW WHEN HE WAS IN HIS FOOD WORLD THAT WAS A DIFFERENTIATOR AND GREAT FOR BLUE APRON 
POD1000000004_S0000077	NOT ONLY DID WADIAK DESIGN THE MENUS AND SOURCE THE PRODUCTS BUT HE ALSO SERVED AS HIS SOCIAL MEDIA FACE OF THE COMPANY HE WAS BLUE APRON'S CULINARY SECRET WEAPON AND DID A SERIES OF EARLY YOUTUBE VIDEOS SHOWCASING HIS KNOW-HOW 
POD1000000004_S0000078	HERE HE IS TRYING TO CONVINCE US THAT ARTICHOKES AREN'T VILE 
POD1000000004_S0000079	EVERYBODY LIKES ARTICHOKES BUT THEY'RE CRAZY WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THEM THEY'RE TOUGH THEY'RE SPINY THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE THEY'RE KIND OF CONFUSING A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE JUST DON'T COOK THEM BECAUSE THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW TO COOK THEM SO 
POD1000000004_S0000081	HE CUTS INTO SOME TRULY REVOLTING ARTICHOKES AND PROCEEDS TO MAKE MY WORST DINING NIGHTMARE 
POD1000000004_S0000082	GET IN THERE WITH A SPOON AND SCOOP OUT THAT REALLY HAIRY CHOKEY INTERIOR AND THE REASON WHY THEY CALL IT THE CHOKE IS BECAUSE IF YOU EAT THIS YOU ARE GONNA CHOKE IT'S FULL OF LITTLE FIBERS AND IT'S LIKE A FISH BONE 
POD1000000004_S0000083	IN THE EARLY DAYS ALL THE FOUNDERS HAD TO HUSTLE LIKE THIS BEFORE THEY HAD STAFF IT WAS SALZBERG PAPAS AND WADIAK PACKING UP BOXES IN A SMALL KITCHEN IN LONG ISLAND CITY NEW YORK 
POD1000000004_S0000084	THEN SEEMINGLY OUT OF NOWHERE THE COMPANY LANDED SOME SWEET VENTURE CAPITAL TO THE TUNE OF THREE MILLION DOLLARS THINGS WERE LOOKING GOOD FOR THE STARTUP 
POD1000000004_S0000085	WITHIN THE FIRST FEW YEARS THE BUSINESS TOOK OFF IN TWENTY-FOURTEEN BLUE APRON WAS SHIPPING SIX HUNDRED THOUSANDS MEALS A MONTH BY TWENTY-SIXTEEN IT WAS EIGHT MILLION MEALS AND A BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE 
POD1000000004_S0000086	WITHIN JUST FIVE YEARS OF ITS FOUNDING THE COMPANY EMPLOYED FORTY-FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE AND WAS VALUED AT NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS BLUE APRON LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ON THE EXPRESS TRAIN TO SUCCESSVILLE 
POD1000000004_S0000087	BLUE APRON SEEMED TO BE SORT OF THE BUZZIEST THE BIGGEST MARKET SHARE THE LEADER IN THIS EMERGING CATEGORY 
POD1000000004_S0000088	WHICH INCLUDED HELLOFRESH SUNBASKET AND ABOUT A MILLION COMPANIES WITH THE WORD CHEF IN THE NAME 
POD1000000004_S0000089	THEN I ACTUALLY TRIED THE PRODUCTS AND IT SEEMED AT LEAST TO ME PERSONALLY JUST AS SOMEONE UM TESTING THE PRODUCTS THAT BLUE APRON OVERALL KIND OF HAD THE EXPERIENCE THAT RESONATED THE MOST WITH ME AND I THOUGHT MIGHT RESONATE THE MOST WITH AMERICANS 
POD1000000004_S0000090	NOW THE THING ABOUT AMERICANS IS 
POD1000000004_S0000091	WE LOVE PRODUCTS THAT CLAIM TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER MORE CONVENIENT LESS OF A HASSLE AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT BLUE APRON WAS DOING IT WAS SAYING HEY WORKING MOM WE KNOW YOU HAVE A LOT IN YOUR PLATE L O L 
POD1000000004_S0000092	WE WANT TO HELP YOU COOK NUTRITIOUS AND DELICIOUS MEALS FOR YOUR FAMILY WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF GOING TO THE GROCERY STORY OR READING A COOKBOOK 
POD1000000004_S0000093	BUT IT WAS ALSO SAYING HEY MILLENNIAL WE KNOW YOU'RE A WORK HARD PLAY HARD EAT SLOPPY TAKEOUT AT NINE P M KIND OF PERSON BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU'D LOVE TO COOK IF ONLY IT WASN'T SUCH A TIME-CONSUMING PAIN IN THE ASS 
POD1000000004_S0000094	SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT SUPER CONVENIENT FOR YOU 
POD1000000004_S0000096	THIS AMERICAN OBSESSION WITH CONVENIENCE AROUND FOOD AND IN PARTICULAR THE MAGICAL HOME-COOKED MEAL MINUS THE EFFORT GOES BACK TO AT LEAST TO THE LATE NINETEENTH CENTURY SAYS CULINARY HISTORIAN LAURA SHAPIRO 
POD1000000004_S0000097	THAT WAS WHEN A PARTICULAR BRAND OF UTOPIAN FICTION BEGAN TO EMERGE 
POD1000000004_S0000098	THE PLOT WAS SORT OF THE SAME SOMEBODY IS TAKING A WALK THEY GET BONKED ON THE HEAD WHEN THEY WAKE UP IT'S FIVE HUNDRED YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND THEY'RE SURROUNDED BY ALL THESE STRANGE LOOKING CREATURES AND IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT WORLD 
POD1000000004_S0000099	AND SOMEBODY TAKES THEM TO DINNER THEY TAKE THEM HOME TO DINNER AND IT'S A MIRACLE DINNER 
POD1000000004_S0000100	THE FOOD JUST APPEARED WITH THE PRESS OF A BUTTON OR THE WAVE OF AN ARM AND IT WAS SCRUMPTIOUS AND FILLING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY BACK THEN DIGESTIBLE 
POD1000000004_S0000101	MIRACLE FOOD IT WAS UTOPIAN FOOD AND THAT HAS BEEN A DREAM I THINK THAT IS ATTACHED ITSELF TO THE AMERICAN DINNER TABLE FOR DECADES AND DECADES 
POD1000000004_S0000102	NOT LONG AFTER THE EMERGENCE OF THIS UTOPIAN FICTION DINNING ACTUALLY DID START TO LOOK LIKE A MIRACLE YOU COULD BUY VEGETABLES IN A CAN AND CHICKEN IN A CAN AND LATER FULL MEALS LIKE SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS IN A CAN 
POD1000000004_S0000103	THEN IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES CAME THE FROZEN TURKEY DINNER JUST WHACK IT IN THE OVEN AND PRESTO A RUBBERY SIMULACRUM OF THE REAL THING BUT IT WAS QUICK AND CLEAN-UP WAS A BREEZE 
POD1000000004_S0000104	MOTHER MURPHY LUCKY ME MY WIFE USES SWANSON T V TURKEY DINNERS AND MAKE YOUR HUSBAND LUCKY TOO GET SWANSON T V TURKEY DINNERS SWANSON T V FRIED CHICKEN DINNERS 
POD1000000004_S0000105	SWANSON T V BEEF DINNERS FROM YOUR GROCER'S BIG FREEZER 
POD1000000004_S0000106	WHEN FROZEN FISH STICKS HIT THE SCENE AROUND THE SAME TIME OH BUDDY IT WAS UTOPIAN FICTION COME TO LIFE 
POD1000000004_S0000107	MASTER CHAD MORLEY ATE MRS PAUL'S FISH STICKS WITH HIS FINGERS 
POD1000000004_S0000108	NOW I'M THIRTY-TWO AND I USE A FORK SOMETIMES 
POD1000000004_S0000109	MRS PAUL'S FISH STICKS YOU'LL NEVER STOP LOVING THEM 
POD1000000004_S0000110	IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS THESE YOU KNOW DEEP-FRIED FROZEN FISH STICKS THAT TASTED NOT AT ALL OF FISH WHICH MEANT THAT AH THAT PEOPLE ADORED THEM 
POD1000000004_S0000111	OBVIOUSLY FISH STICKS TOOK OFF AND THE INDUSTRY USED THAT AS AN EXCUSE TO STICKILY EVERYTHING CHICKEN EGGPLANT LIMA BEANS WHATEVER YOU COULD DEEP FRY AND FREEZE THE PACKAGED FOOD INDUSTRY TRIED IT 
POD1000000004_S0000112	THE POST-WAR YEARS ALSO BROUGHT AN EXPLOSION OF FAST FOOD AND TAKEOUT MEALS AND NOW THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY WE CAN ORDER JUST ABOUT ANY FOOD WE WANT FROM SOME VEGAN DRUMSTICKS TO A PRIX FIXE HAUTE CUISINE MEAL JUST BY PRESSING AN APP 
POD1000000004_S0000113	ALL OF THESE ITERATIONS OF THE MIRACLE DINNER IT'S LIKE THEY AIM AT THREE LONGINGS THAT WOMEN HAVE ALWAYS HAD WHEN THEY THINK ABOUT MAKING DINNER THEY WANT IT TO BE EFFORTLESS 
POD1000000004_S0000114	THEY WANT IT TO BE DELICIOUS AND THEY WANT IT TO HAVE THE MORAL VALUE OF HOME COOKING 
POD1000000004_S0000115	THE HOME COOKING ASPECT OF THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST RESONANT 
POD1000000004_S0000116	THE THING THAT HOME COOKING DELIVERS THAT NONE OF THESE OTHER THINGS DO IS THAT IT SATISFIES I THINK WHAT WE ALL FEEL AS THE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO COOK 
POD1000000004_S0000117	THERE'S SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T CLICK IN WHEN THE THING COMES IN FROM OUTSIDE 
POD1000000004_S0000118	AND THIS IS A GREAT THING FOR A COMPANY LIKE BLUE APRON BECAUSE 
POD1000000004_S0000119	BLUE APRON INCHES A LITTLE CLOSER TO THAT IT IT JUST IT GETS YOU THAT MUCH CLOSER TO FEELING AS THOUGH YOU HAVE COOKED TO THIS 
POD1000000004_S0000120	NOTICE SHAPIRO SAID FEELING AS THOUGH YOU COOKED SOMETHING BECAUSE FOR HER WHAT BLUE APRON IS DOING DESPITE ALL OF ITS FRESH INGREDIENTS AND CHEF INSPIRED RECIPES IS HELPING YOU ASSEMBLE 
POD1000000004_S0000121	THEY KIND OF FOOL YOU INTO THINKING YOU'RE COOKING WHERE IS REAL COOKING HANDS-ON COOKING KNOWLEDGEABLE COOKING HAS TO DO WITH COOKING DAY AFTER DAY 
POD1000000004_S0000122	DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE MAKING FABULOUS ELABORATE MEALS DAY AFTER DAY EVEN IF IT'S THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE THING THAT'S COOKING 
POD1000000004_S0000123	SURE GETTING A DIME BAG OF ZA'ATAR A THIMBLEFUL OF PEPITAS AND A LITERAL TABLESPOON OF SESAME OIL IN YOUR MEAL KIT DOES HAVE A SOMEWHAT INFANTILIZING EFFECT 
POD1000000004_S0000124	BUT IN BLUE APRON'S EARLY YEARS PLENTY OF PEOPLE WERE HAPPY TO HAVE EVERYTHING PORTIONED OUT FOR THEM BUT CONVINCING POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS THAT THEY WANTED AND NEEDED A SERVICE LIKE THAT THAT COST THE COMPANY SOME BIG CASH 
POD1000000004_S0000125	IN THE FORM OF FREE MEALS TONS OF SPECIALS AND ENDLESS ADVERTISING ANYONE WHO LISTENED TO PODCASTS IN TWENTY-FIFTEEN THROUGH TWENTY-EIGHTEEN IS BOUND TO HAVE HEARD AT LEAST ONE DISINTERESTED PODCAST HOST GIVE A LACKLUSTER BLUE APRON AD READ 
POD1000000004_S0000127	IN BIZ SPEAK ALL OF THIS IS KNOWN AS THE CAC OR CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST 
POD1000000004_S0000128	WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE IS THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THE COMPANY SPENT 
POD1000000004_S0000129	ON MARKETING TO ACQUIRE CUSTOMERS DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT THEY ACTUALLY ACQUIRED 
POD1000000004_S0000130	THAT'S DAN MCCARTHY HE'S THE MARKETING PROFESSOR AT EMORY UNIVERSITY'S BUSINESS SCHOOL AND HE'S STUDIED BLUE APRON FOR YEARS MCCARTHY SAYS THAT IN THE EARLY DAYS BLUE APRON WAS SPENDING ABOUT SIXTY SEVENTY DOLLARS PER CUSTOMER 
POD1000000004_S0000131	BUT THEN AS PEOPLE CAME AND WENT BLUE APRON HAD TO SPEND MORE AND MORE MONEY TO GET NEW CUSTOMERS ON BOARD THE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST JUST KEPT CREEPING UP AND UP AND UP UNTIL IT NEARLY DOUBLED 
POD1000000004_S0000132	AND YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU'RE SPENDING A HUNDRED TWENTY JUST TO BRING SOMEBODY IN AH WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF PROFIT THAT YOU NEED AFTER THAT TO TO BREAK EVEN ON THAT CUSTOMER THAT'S A TOUGHER PROPOSITION 
POD1000000004_S0000133	THE MORE MONEY BLUE APRON SPENT THE HARDER IT WAS TO RECOUP THE INVESTMENT WHICH BRINGS US TO THE SECOND PROBLEM PREVENTING CUSTOMERS FROM BOLTING ONCE THE COMPANY HAS SPENT ALL THAT MONEY TO BRING THEM IN 
POD1000000004_S0000134	HOW MANY CUSTOMERS STICK AROUND IS MEASURED BY A REALLY IMPORTANT METRIC CALLED CHURN RATE THE CHURN RATE TELLS YOU THE RATE AT WHICH CUSTOMERS COME INTO AND SPIN OUT OF THE BUSINESS 
POD1000000004_S0000135	IF YOU'RE SPENDING A LOT OF CASH TO LAND NEW CUSTOMERS AND THEY DON'T STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF THEM YOU HAVE HIGH CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COSTS AND A HIGH CHURN RATE 
POD1000000004_S0000136	THAT'S WHERE BLUE APRON FOUND ITSELF AND EVEN THE MOST BASIC COOKING DODO COULD TELL YOU THAT'S A GOURMET RECIPE FOR LOSING A LOT OF MONEY 
POD1000000004_S0000137	OUR PAL DR GREEN USED BLUE APRON FOR ABOUT A YEAR WHICH IS WAY LONGER THAN MOST OF ITS CUSTOMERS STUCK AROUND 
POD1000000004_S0000138	YES ABOUT HALF THE PEOPLE WERE CHURNING OUT IN A MONTH BY SIX MONTHS ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THEIR CUSTOMERS WERE CHURNING OUT THEY JUST WEREN'T WEREN'T ABLE TO KEEP THOSE CUSTOMERS FOR AS LONG AS THEY THEY SHOULD 
POD1000000004_S0000139	DESPITE BLUE APRON'S EARLY SUCCESS AND GROWTH ONE NUT THE COMPANY'S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO CRACK IS HOW TO STOP THAT OUTFLOW HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE TO SUBSCRIBE AND STAY SUBSCRIBED AT LEAST LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF THEM IT'S A PUZZLE 
POD1000000004_S0000140	BUT DESPITE ITS HIGH CHURN RATE BLUE APRON WAS STILL THE MARKET LEADER IT HAD GOTTEN A SLIGHT JUMPSTART ON RIVAL HELLOFRESH AND IT WAS STARTING TO LOOK A REAL SEXY TO BIG INVESTORS 
POD1000000004_S0000141	THEY WERE THE EIGHT HUNDRED POUND GORILLAS AND EVEN THOUGH THE SPACE ITSELF WASN'T THAT THAT LARGE AT THE TIME IT WAS STILL SOMETHING LIKE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AND GROWING REALLY QUICKLY 
POD1000000004_S0000142	ON ITS FACE BUSINESS SEEMED BOOMING BUT THE WHOLE MEAL KIT MARKET WAS ON THE CUSP OF A SHAKE-UP 
POD1000000004_S0000143	IN TWENTY-SEVENTEEN GROCERY CHAINS ALBERTSONS AND KROGER EACH PICKED OFF COMPETING MEAL KIT COMPANIES THEN ANOTHER BLUE APRON RIVAL CHEF'D ABRUPTLY SHUT DOWN AND LAID OFF ALL ITS EMPLOYEES ONLY TO BE BOUGHT A WEEK LATER 
POD1000000004_S0000144	AND SO BLUE APRON WAS AT A CROSSROADS SAYS ALEX KONRAD 
POD1000000004_S0000145	FOR STARTUPS THE MOST COMMON EXITS ARE YOU KNOW YOU FAIL YOU GO PUBLIC OR YOU GET BOUGHT THOSE ARE REALLY THE ONLY TRADITIONAL OUTCOMES AND SO FOR THE COMPANIES THAT DIDN'T WANNA FAIL THEY WERE GONNA HAVE TO GO PUBLIC SOMEDAY OR SELL 
POD1000000004_S0000146	LIKE THAT THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE REALITY 
POD1000000004_S0000147	SO BLUE APRON HAD THREE CHOICES PACK IT IN SELL OR GO PUBLIC WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK WHEN WE COME BACK JOIN ME IN MY OUTDATED CONDO KITCHEN AS I WHIP UP SOME DELICIOUS BLUE APRON MEALS

POD1000000004_S0000166	NO STORY ABOUT BLUE APRON COULD BE CALLED COMPLETE WITHOUT SAMPLING THE PRODUCT SO I ORDERED UP A BOX AND PAID FOR IT MIND YOU 
POD1000000004_S0000167	OKAY SO I JUST GOT MY BLUE APRON BOX AT MY DOORSTEP AND WHEN I PICKED IT UP I COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW HEAVY IT WAS 
POD1000000004_S0000168	WHEN THE BOX ARRIVED IT FELT LIKE CHRISTMAS EXCEPT BETTER BECAUSE THE FOOD WASN'T MEDIOCRE AND ARRANGED IN A SHRINK-WRAPPED BASKET 
POD1000000004_S0000169	SO LET'S CRACK INTO THIS BOX 
POD1000000004_S0000170	INSIDE THERE WERE TWO BUNCHES OF KALES SOME LOOSE ONIONS AND ABOUT A MILLION TINY BAGGIES OF NICK NACKS INCLUDING TWO TABLESPOONS OF CREME FRAICHE A QUARTER OF A CUP OF PANKO BREADCRUMBS AND ONE TEASPOON OF SOMETHING CALLED FURIKAKE 
POD1000000004_S0000171	WHICH ACCORDING TO THE BLUE APRON RECIPE WAS SUPPOSED TO QUOTE LEND EVEN MORE SAVORY FLAVOR TO MY DISH YUM 
POD1000000004_S0000173	THERE'S THE TINIEST THE TINIEST TINIEST PORTION OF BROWN RICE I MEAN THIS MUST BE MAYBE HALF A CUP IN A BAG MAYBE THREE TIMES THE SIZE 
POD1000000004_S0000174	I DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE SAD TO COOK THESE DISHES BY MYSELF SO I INVITED MY GIRLFRIEND OVER TO EXPERIENCE THE MAGIC OF BLUE APRON WITH ME 
POD1000000004_S0000175	YOU HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN MEALS TONIGHT 
POD1000000004_S0000176	I'M SO READY MOSTLY BECAUSE I'M SO HUNGRY 
POD1000000004_S0000177	OH WELL WE HAD THE CHOICE OF THREE DISHES BUT ONE OF THEM HAD CILANTRO SAUCE SO NO THANK YOU ANOTHER WAS LIKE A SPICY INDIAN SITUATION AND I WAS FEELING KIND OF BASIC SO I CHOSE THE PESTO AND KALE PASTA WITH GOAT CHEESE 
POD1000000004_S0000178	IT SAYS THIS QUICK-COOKING PASTA GETS A ONE-TWO PUNCH OF IRRESISTIBLE FLAVOR FROM A DOLLOP OF CREAMY GOAT CHEESE FOR DELICIOUS TANG AND OUR HERBACEOUS BASIL PESTO STIRRED INTO THE WARM PASTA AND GARLICKY KALE JUST BEFORE SERVING 
POD1000000004_S0000179	BY THE WAY THAT WAS A WRONG 
POD1000000004_S0000180	HERBACEOUS 
POD1000000004_S0000181	A TOUCH OF CRUSHED RED PEPPER 
POD1000000004_S0000182	TECHNICALLY WE PICKED THE EASIEST DISH SO WHAT THINGS WERE GOING WELL UNTIL I DROPPED A GARLIC CLOVE DOWN THE INSINKERATOR 
POD1000000004_S0000183	OH HANNA NO GET YOUR HAND OUT OF THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL 
POD1000000004_S0000184	AFTER THAT NEAR CATASTROPHE WE BOILED THE FRESH CAVATELLI SAUTEED THE KALE WITH GARLIC AND RED PEPPER FLAKES ADDED THE PESTO AND THE DOLLOP OF GOAT CHEESE AND VOILA 
POD1000000004_S0000185	CAN I GET YOU A BOWL OF PASTA 
POD1000000004_S0000186	WHAT WHY YES 
POD1000000004_S0000187	YOU COULD 
POD1000000004_S0000188	AND I'M HERE TO REPORT WE MADE A DAMN FINE MEAL THE KALE WAS TENDER CRISP AND VERY WELL SEASONED THE CAVATELLI WAS PERFECTLY AL DENTE WELL DONE HANNA AND THE CHEESE ADDED SOME GOOD SALTINESS 
POD1000000004_S0000189	I WOULD SAY WE WERE PERFECTLY SATISFIED DINERS BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE 
POD1000000004_S0000190	CLEANUP IS PRACTICALLY NOTHING BECAUSE EVERYTHING CAME OUT OF A PACKET SO REALLY WE'RE ONLY LEFT WITH 
POD1000000004_S0000191	ACTUALLY THAT'S REALLY NICE 
POD1000000004_S0000192	A COUPLE OF DISHES 
POD1000000004_S0000193	I DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE THAT I THINK THAT'S REALLY NICE 
POD1000000004_S0000194	BUT NOT EVERYONE WHO'S USED BLUE APRON HAS APPRECIATED THAT THE COMPANY HAS GOTTEN FLAK FOR ITS ABUNDANT PACKAGING THOUGH MUCH OF IT IS NOW RECYCLABLE AND CUSTOMERS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT THE RECIPES WERE TOO COMPLICATED 
POD1000000004_S0000195	I MADE FOUR BLUE APRON MEALS FOR THIS STORY AND FOR A MIDDLING COOK WITH A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF COOKWARE I THOUGHT THE DISHES WERE PRETTY SIMPLE TO ASSEMBLE ALSO PRETTY TASTY 
POD1000000004_S0000196	I WOULD MAKE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE DISHES AGAIN BUT I DO THE SHOPPING MYSELF WHICH I GUESS SORT OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE 
POD1000000004_S0000197	WHEN I OPENED MY FIRST BLUE APRON BOX IT WAS A NOVELTY A CORNUCOPIA AND CARDBOARD BUT THEN I FORGOT TO CANCEL MY SUBSCRIPTION AND I GOT A SECOND BOX BY ACCIDENT 
POD1000000004_S0000198	THAT ONE WASN'T AS EXCITING BY THEN I UNDERSTOOD THE GIMMICK AND THE EXCITEMENT OF DISCOVERY KIND OF FIZZLED IN THIS WAY I'M NOT TOO DIFFERENT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO TRY BLUE APRON SAYS PROFESSOR DAN MCCARTHY 
POD1000000004_S0000199	DISCOVERY DOESN'T TEND TO LAST THAT LONG THERE'S A BUNCH OF PEOPLE THEY LOOK AT BLUE APRON AS THIS IT'S LIKE I WANT KIND OF THIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT EVERY MONTH 
POD1000000004_S0000200	AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY MAY WANT THAT INITIALLY BUT AFTER YOU'VE BEEN SURPRISED AND DELIGHTED A FEW TIMES YOU SAY YOU KNOW I'M PRETTY GOOD I I DON'T NEED ANY MORE OF THIS SURPRISE AND DELIGHT 
POD1000000004_S0000201	BUT BLUE APRON EXECS WERE LIKE AH YEAH YOU DO YOU NEED IT AND YOU WANT IT AND THEY BELIEVED IN THEIR PRODUCT'S ABILITY NOT JUST TO CONTINUALLY DELIGHT BUT DO ACTUALLY PROVIDE A VALUABLE SERVICE TO PEOPLE 
POD1000000004_S0000202	AND ALL THAT MEANT THAT IN TWENTY-SEVENTEEN THE COMPANY HAD TO WORK OUT ITS OPTIONS PACK IT IN SELL OR GO PUBLIC 
POD1000000004_S0000203	AND THE HIGHER-UPS DECIDED ON GOING PUBLIC 
POD1000000004_S0000204	NOW BEFORE OFFERING UP PUBLIC STOCK IN THE COMPANY FOR THE FIRST TIME BLUE APRON WANTED TO SHOW STRONG CUSTOMER GROWTH SO THEY STARTED TO AMP UP SPENDING TO BRING IN NEW USERS 
POD1000000004_S0000205	REMEMBER CAC THE CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST IN THE YEAR BEFORE THE I P O BLUE APRON INCREASED ITS MARKETING CASH BY ALMOST TWO HUNDRED PERCENT 
POD1000000004_S0000206	BUT NONE OF THIS MARKETING RESULTED IN A HUGE NEW CUSTOMER HAUL AND THAT SAYS FORBES'S ALEX KONRAD MADE INVESTORS A LITTLE LESS IN LOVE WITH THE COMPANY 
POD1000000004_S0000207	IT WAS HARD TO MAKE A REALLY ATTRACTIVE YOU KNOW FUTURE-FACING STORY FOR LIKE HOW BLUE APRON REALLY BECOMES THAT HUGE 
POD1000000004_S0000208	BLUE APRON'S BOOKS WEREN'T THE ONLY THING THAT MADE INVESTORS TURN UP THEIR NOSES AROUND THE I P O A COUPLE WEEKS BEFORE THE BLUE APRON TEAM WAS SET TO RING THE BELL FOR NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AMAZON MADE A LITTLE ANNOUNCEMENT 
POD1000000004_S0000209	IT WAS BUYING WHOLE FOODS IN A THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR DEAL FOR BLUE APRON IT WAS LIKE GETTING UPSTAGED AT YOUR OWN WEDDING BY AN IMPOSSIBLY RICH AND INFINITELY MORE BEAUTIFUL GUEST OF A GUEST 
POD1000000004_S0000210	WHEN AMAZON'S ACQUISITION OF WHOLE FOODS WAS ANNOUNCED THAT WAS JUST DEVASTATING UM EVEN JUST PSYCHOLOGICALLY IT FELT LIKE UM YOU KNOW HERE COME THE GIANTS 
POD1000000004_S0000211	AND IF AMAZON CAN SELL THINGS TOO ONLINE REALLY WELL AND WHOLE FOODS HAS PRETTY GOOD INGREDIENTS WHAT IS BLUE APRON REALLY SELLING HERE 
POD1000000004_S0000212	AND THEN OF COURSE AMAZON TRADEMARKED ITS OWN MEAL KIT OFFERING 
POD1000000004_S0000213	EVERYONE WAS AH VERY CONCERNED THAT AND BASICALLY THIS WAS GONNA BE THE NEXT YOU KNOW I I WON'T CALL BLUE APRON END YOU KNOW BUT I WOULD SAY EVERYONE AGREES AMAZON'S WAY BIGGER SO 
POD1000000004_S0000215	THEY'RE JUST GONNA BOLD THEIR WAY RIGHT IN AND AND STAMP THIS THIS INDUSTRY OUT AND SO THAT THAT WAS A BIG LURKING CONCERN 
POD1000000004_S0000216	BLUE APRON'S I P O IN THE SUMMER OF TWENTY-SEVENTEEN RAISED THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT A THIRD OF WHAT THE COMPANY ANTICIPATED STOCK WENT FOR ABOUT TEN DOLLARS A SHARE RATHER THAN THE EXPECTED FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN DOLLARS 
POD1000000004_S0000217	IT WAS A TURBULENT UM I P O TO SAY THE LEAST 
POD1000000004_S0000218	SOON BLUE APRON CO-FOUNDER AND C E O MATT SALZBERG SEEMED PRETTY UPBEAT ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION ON C N B C 
POD1000000004_S0000219	I'M HONESTLY NOT HERE TO REALLY TALK ABOUT THE PRICING OF BLUE APRON STOCK THAT'S REALLY UP TO THE INVESTORS TO DECIDE YOU KNOW BLUE APRON IS HERE BECAUSE WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE BIG OPPORTUNITY THAT WE'RE GOING AFTER 
POD1000000004_S0000220	WE'RE TACKLING A HUGE MARKET AND WE'RE FOCUSED ON THE LONG TERM QUITE FRANKLY AND THE STOCK PRICE TODAY WHETHER IT'S UP DOWN LEFT OR RIGHT IS REALLY JUST THE BEGINNING OF THIS NEW CHAPTER IN OUR COMPANY'S LIFE THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT 
POD1000000004_S0000222	ONE THING SALZBERG MENTIONED IN THAT CLIP WAS HOW HIS COMPANY WAS TACKLING A HUGE MARKET NOW IF YOU'RE DEFINING THE MARKET AS ALL THE PEOPLE WHO EAT FOOD IN AMERICA THEN YEAH THAT'S A HUGE MARKET 
POD1000000004_S0000223	BUT ACCORDING TO THE GOOD FOLKS AT MARKET RESEARCH COMPANY PACKAGED FACTS THAT MARKET HAS A CEILING AND NOT LIKE A CATHEDRAL CEILING 
POD1000000004_S0000224	INITIALLY THE MARKET WAS DEFINITELY EXPANDING EXPONENTIALLY AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THE INTEREST INITIALLY CAME FROM IF YOU'RE SEEING THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE HAVING A HUNDRED PERCENT GROWTH LIKE THAT'S REALLY SIGNIFICANT 
POD1000000004_S0000225	THAT'S CARA RASCH SHE'S A FOOD AND BEVERAGE ANALYST WITH PACKAGED FACTS 
POD1000000004_S0000226	ONE OF THE WHOLE THINGS THAT I THINK WENT WRONG WITH THE INDUSTRY IS PEOPLE THOUGHT THERE WAS A VERY BIG ADDRESSABLE MARKET FOR MEAL KITS BUT AS IT TURNS OUT THERE REALLY ISN'T 
POD1000000004_S0000227	IT'S HARD TO GAUGE BUT RASCH ESTIMATES THAT ONLY ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THE U S POPULATION USES HOME DELIVERY MEAL KITS AND SHE SAYS THE MARKET KIND OF PEAKED TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO 
POD1000000004_S0000228	SINCE BLUE APRON STARTED MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED-FIFTY MEAL KIT SERVICES HAVE COME ON THE SCENE BUT ONLY ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY ARE NATIONAL OPERATIONS WITH HELLOFRESH NOW THE CLEAR MARKET LEADER 
POD1000000004_S0000229	REMEMBER WHEN WE SAID AMAZON TRADEMARKED ITS MEAL KIT BACK IN TWENTY-SEVENTEEN RASCH SAYS THE COMPANY NEVER DID MUCH WITH IT AND THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR THAT MEAL KIT DELIVERY IS NOT A GROWING GLOBAL CONCERN 
POD1000000004_S0000230	I THINK THAT AMAZON SAW THAT MUCH OF THE MARKET FOR MEAL KITS HAD ALREADY BEEN ADDRESSED BY THE COMPETITORS THAT WERE ALREADY THERE SO THEY DIDN'T TRY REALLY TO BREAK INTO THAT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T SEE MUCH POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH ANYMORE 
POD1000000004_S0000231	IT SEEMS LIKE AMAZON WAS RIGHT TO HOLD OFF IN TWENTY-SEVENTEEN BLUE APRON HEMORRHAGED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS AND ITS STOCK PRICE HAD TANKED JUST TWO DOLLARS AND NIGHT-NINE CENTS A SHARE BY THE END OF THE YEAR 
POD1000000004_S0000232	AND THERE WERE MORE PROBLEMS WITHIN A MONTH OF THE I P O CO-FOUNDER MATT WADIAK STEPPED DOWN AS C O O MATT SALZBERG THEN THE C E O RESIGNED HIS POST SHORTLY THEREAFTER 
POD1000000004_S0000233	BLUE APRON'S EXPENSIVE BRAND SPANKING NEW FULFILLMENT CENTER IN NEW JERSEY HAD A BUNCH OF TECH BUGS THAT NEEDED TO BE WORKED OUT AND WORKERS FROM ITS CALIFORNIA OPERATION FILED A CLASS-ACTION LAWSUIT OVER A ALLEGED MISSING WAGES 
POD1000000004_S0000234	THINGS WERE LOOKING PRETTY GRIM FOR THE ONCE-HYPED COMPANY 
POD1000000004_S0000235	WELCOME TO TRADING NATION I'M ERIC CHEMI LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ONE OF LAST YEAR'S HIGH PROFILE I P OS THAT'S GETTING ABSOLUTELY SMOKED WE'RE TALKING OF COURSE ABOUT BLUE APRON THE STOCK SINKING AS MUCH AS FOUR PERCENT ON FRIDAY 
POD1000000004_S0000236	BY THE END OF TWENTY-EIGHTEEN BLUE APRON STOCK DIPPED BELOW A DOLLAR A SHARE AND THE SLIDE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE LETTING UP 
POD1000000004_S0000237	THE FOLLOWING SUMMER THE COMPANY TRIED TO MOVE MEANT TO KEEP IT FROM BEING BOOTED FROM THE STOCK EXCHANGE IT'S CALLED A REVERSE STOCKS 
POD1000000004_S0000238	SPLIT AND BASICALLY IT MEANS THAT THE COMPANY BUNDLED IT SHARES SO YOU GET A FEWER TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES BUT EACH SHARE IS WORTH MORE LIKE TRADING IN FOUR QUARTERS FOR A DOLLAR 
POD1000000004_S0000239	THE MOVE RAISED THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE BUT CUSTOMERS STILL WEREN'T FLOCKING TO BLUE APRON'S BOXES NOW AT THIS POINT I WOULD HAVE THROWN IN THE TOWEL BUT NOT C E O LINDA FINDLEY KOZLOWSKI 
POD1000000004_S0000240	THE COMPANY WOULDN'T MAKE KOZLOWSKI AVAILABLE FOR A CHAT BUT HERE SHE IS LAST YEAR ON C N B C'S SQUAWK ON THE STREETTALKING ABOUT HOW JAZZED SHE IS ABOUT BLUE APRON'S PROSPECTS 
POD1000000004_S0000241	AND OUR RECIPES OUR INGREDIENTS OUR CULINARY AUTHORITY OUR BRAND RECOGNITION IS BY FAR STILL NUMBER ONE SO WE FEEL CONFIDENT THAT WHEN WE'RE TALKING TO INVESTORS THEY APPRECIATE AND UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING HERE IT'S REALLY JUST ABOUT GETTING EXECUTION RIGHT AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY 
POD1000000004_S0000242	COOL COOL COOL BUT ALSO BLUE APRON WAS THINKING ABOUT GETTING DOWN WITH SOME STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES SAYS MARKETWATCH'S TONYA GARCIA 
POD1000000004_S0000243	STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES WHICH YOU KNOW DOESN'T MEANS A LOT AND AND NOTHING AT THE SAME TIME RIGHT 
POD1000000004_S0000244	IT'S LIKE SAYING I'M TOTALLY HAPPY BEING SINGLE BUT I'D BE INTO DATING IF THE RIGHT PERSON CAME ALONG 
POD1000000004_S0000245	IT'S KIND OF LIKE ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT COMPANIES WILL SAY WHEN THEY'RE JUST LIKE WELL WE'D BE OPEN TO YOU KNOW GETTING BOUGHT OR A PARTNERSHIP IF YOU'RE INTERESTED YOU KNOW KIND OF A THING 
POD1000000004_S0000246	IN EARLY TWENTY-TWENTY BLUE APRON PUT THE WORD OUT THAT IT WAS INTERESTED IN POSSIBLY GETTING SCOOPED UP MAYBE BY A BIG GROCERY CHAIN OR SOMEONE ELSE WITH DEEP POCKETS WHO WANTED TO OWN A MEAL KIT DELIVERY BUSINESS 
POD1000000004_S0000247	AT THE SAME TIME GARCIA SAYS THE COMPANY ACTED LIKE IT WAS IN TURNAROUND MODE IT DECIDED TO STREAMLINE OPERATIONS INCLUDING SHUTTING DOWN ITS FULFILLMENT CENTER IN TEXAS 
POD1000000004_S0000248	IT ALSO DID AWAY WITH TRYING TO SHOVEL EVERYONE WHO HAD EVER EATEN FOOD INTO THE TOP OF ITS CUSTOMER FUNNEL 
POD1000000004_S0000249	THEY'VE DECIDED TO FOCUS ON WHAT THEY CALL THEIR CORE CUSTOMERS AND THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO AREN'T GOING TO DO LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE AND USE A COUPON AND YOU KNOW GET BLUE APRON FOR A MONTH AND THEN CANCEL THEIR SUBSCRIPTION 
POD1000000004_S0000250	SO AT THE SAME TIME BLUE APRON WAS LOOKING TO SELL IT WAS ALSO DOUBLING DOWN ON ITS MISSION THESE WERE LAST-GASP EFFORTS IT WANTED TO SAVE ITSELF 
POD1000000004_S0000251	AND THEN CAME THE MOST UNLIKELY LIFELINE ANYONE COULD THINK OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC A HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS THAT REQUIRED THOSE OF US WITHOUT ESSENTIAL JOBS TO PRACTICALLY NEVER LEAVE OUR HOUSES 
POD1000000004_S0000252	ONLINE GROCERY DELIVERY SHOT THROUGH THE ROOF AND SUDDENLY EVERYONE REMEMBERED ABOUT THIS COMPANY THEY HEARD ABOUT ON A PODCAST AD THREE YEARS AGO 
POD1000000004_S0000253	THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN ACTUALLY A BIT OF A GOOD THING FOR THEM BECAUSE IT HAS RAISED DEMAND 
POD1000000004_S0000254	BLUE APRON SEES A LOT OF POTENTIAL IN WHAT THE COMPANY IS OFFERING ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT MORE AMERICANS SEEM TO BE INTERESTED IN COOKING AT HOME THANKS CORONA 
POD1000000004_S0000255	IF YOU'RE BLUE APRON THEN YOU'RE PROBABLY THINKING YOU KNOW WELL IF WE DO A GOOD JOB SOME OF THIS WILL STICK 
POD1000000004_S0000256	IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF TWENTY-TWENTY WHEN CORONAVIRUS BROUGHT AMERICA TO A STANDSTILL BLUE APRON CUSTOMER ORDERS WERE UP A BIT THOUGH THEY DIDN'T SPIKE LIKE THE MARKETS HOPED THE COMPANY STILL LOST TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS BUT THAT WAS A LITTLE BETTER THAN THE PREVIOUS QUARTER 
POD1000000004_S0000257	ON ITS FIRST QUARTER EARNINGS CALL OF TWENTY-TWENTY THE COMPANY'S C E O AND C F O SHOOK THEIR POM-POMS LIKE THEY WERE ON AN EPISODE OF CHEERS BUT LIKE THE VERSION THAT FEATURES SLIGHTLY WOODEN CORPORATE EXECUTIVES 
POD1000000004_S0000258	SO NOW I THINK THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THING UM YOU KNOW PUTS US IN A GOOD POSITION GOING FORWARD AND AND AH YOU KNOW WE CAN'T SPECIFICALLY UM GUIDE WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES 
POD1000000004_S0000259	YOU KNOW WE DO BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SOME POSITIVE UM EFFECTS AS WE MOVE OUT OF Q TWO 
POD1000000004_S0000260	THE PANDEMIC SEEMS LIKE IT'S GIVEN BLUE APRON A DECENT LITTLE BOOST IN THE SECOND QUARTER THE COMPANY BROUGHT IN TWENTY THOUSANDS MORE SUBSCRIBERS BUT THAT'S STILL WAY BELOW WHERE THEY WERE IN TWENTY-NINETEEN 
POD1000000004_S0000261	IT'S ANYONE'S GUESS WHETHER BLUE APRON SPECIFICALLY AND MEAL KIT DELIVERY MORE GENERALLY ARE HERE TO STAY THE BUSINESS KICKI THEANDER FOUNDED IN SWEDEN THIRTEEN YEARS AGO IS STILL DELIVERING WEEKLY MEAL FIXINGS TO BUSY SWEDES 
POD1000000004_S0000262	AND DESPITE ITS OWN TURBULENCE MARKET LEADER HELLOFRESH IS STILL CRANKING OUT BOXES AND THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF SMALL MEAL KIT COMPANIES LOOKING TO FILL PALEO OR VEGAN OR REGIONAL CUISINE NICHES 
POD1000000004_S0000263	NO ONE KNOWS WHAT THE TRUE IMPACT OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC WILL BE ON HOW WE EAT AND WHERE AND WHEN NOT YET ANYWAY GROCERY DELIVERY SEEMS LIKE IT'S HERE TO STAY 
POD1000000004_S0000264	MAYBE HIGH-END RESTAURANT TAKEOUT WILL ALSO STICK AROUND IN SOME FORM IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO TOOK UP HOME COOKING OUT OF NECESSITY WILL CONTINUE TO BAKE CRUSTY SOURDOUGH AND WHIP UP ELABORATE CURRIES WHEN WE CAN ALL SAFELY FREQUENT OUR FAVORITE LOCAL SPOTS 
POD1000000004_S0000265	BLUE APRON IS BANKING ON A SEA CHANGE IN HOW AMERICANS EAT THE COMPANY THAT WAS SHOPPING FOR A BUYER JUST A MONTH BEFORE THE PANDEMIC HIT IS NOW TRYING TO TURN A CATACLYSMIC GLOBAL EVENT INTO A BUSINESS-SAVING OPPORTUNITY

POD1000000010_S0000017	SO SCARLETT LEADS US INSIDE THE HOUSE AND I REMEMBER WE TOOK OUR JACKETS OFF IN THE MUD ROOM AND HANGING THERE WAS A FIRST-GRADER'S BLACK-AND-BLUE SKI JACKET 
POD1000000010_S0000018	AND SCARLETT STOPPED AND SHE PULLED OUT A PAIR OF THESE FUNNY-LOOKING TEETH OUT OF THE POCKET JOKE TEETH 
POD1000000010_S0000019	I ALWAYS SAY THAT HE WORE THESE LITTLE TEETH CAUSE HE WAS SUCH A GOOFBALL TO SCHOOL EVERY DAY 
POD1000000010_S0000020	LITTLE SILVER TEETH 
POD1000000010_S0000021	YEAH 
POD1000000010_S0000022	AH 
POD1000000010_S0000023	SCARLETT'S SON JESSE HAD THESE TEETH IN THIS COAT AT SANDY HOOK ELEMENTARY SCHOOL THE DAY HE DIED 
POD1000000010_S0000024	MY NAME'S SCARLETT LEWIS AND I'M THE FOUNDER OF THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE MOVEMENT 
POD1000000010_S0000025	AND I FOUNDED THIS ORGANIZATION FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF MY SIX-YEAR-OLD SON ALONGSIDE NINETEEN OF HIS CLASSMATES AND SIX EDUCATORS IN ONE OF THE WORST MASS MURDERS IN U S HISTORY 
POD1000000010_S0000026	HERE IN SANDY HOOK CONNECTICUT IN TWENTY-TWELVE SCARLETT LIVED THROUGH EVERY PARENT'S NIGHTMARE 
POD1000000010_S0000027	AND FOLLOWING THAT I REALIZED THAT AH THERE ISN'T A THEY OUT THERE 
POD1000000010_S0000028	AND BY THEY SHE MEANS SOMEONE ELSE WHO'S GONNA COME INTO OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR HOMES AND HELP KIDS REPLACE THEIR ANGER AND VIOLENCE WITH WARMTH AND COMPASSION 
POD1000000010_S0000029	RIGHT THEN WE COME INTO THE SUNNY KITCHEN WHICH IS PAINTED TURQUOISE AND BRIGHT YELLOW 
POD1000000010_S0000030	EVERY SURFACE IS COVERED WITH PAINTINGS SCARLETT'S DONE AND PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HIS BROTHER J T 
POD1000000010_S0000031	AND ONE OF THE CABINETS HAS CHALKBOARD PAINT ON IT AND ON IT IS A MESSAGE FROM JESSE 
POD1000000010_S0000032	WE WE HARDLY EVER USE THIS THIS IS AH SPRAY-PAINTED CHALKBOARD 
POD1000000010_S0000033	SCARLETT DIDN'T NOTICE THIS MESSAGE UNTIL SHE RETURNED TO THE HOUSE SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE SHOOTING TO FIND CLOTHES FOR JESSE TO WEAR IN HIS CASKET 
POD1000000010_S0000034	SHE WALKED IN AND FROZE 
POD1000000010_S0000035	I SAW THAT NURTURING HEALING LOVE AND I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT 
POD1000000010_S0000036	NURTURING HEALING LOVE YOU CAN SEE THOSE THREE WORDS THEY'RE SPELLED PHONETICALLY IN A SIX-YEAR-OLD'S JAGGED SCRAWL 
POD1000000010_S0000037	I THOUGHT IT WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO COME BACK HERE I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M CRYING CAUSE USUALLY I DON'T SORRY

POD1000000010_S0000041	BUT THE MOMENT SHE SAW THEM SHE REALIZED 
POD1000000010_S0000042	THIS IS MY LIFE NOW I KNEW I WOULD BE SPENDING THE REST OF MY LIFE SPREADING THIS MESSAGE

POD1000000010_S0000060	JUST IF YOU LOVE THEM THEY'LL BECOME KIND 
POD1000000010_S0000061	WELL YOU KNOW WHAT ANYA YOU ARE NOT ALONE IN THAT ASSUMPTION 
POD1000000010_S0000062	WE OFTEN JUST EXPECT PEOPLE TO BE KIND WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT IT 
POD1000000010_S0000063	WE THINK OH YOU'RE A GOOD KID YOU'RE GONNA BE KIND 
POD1000000010_S0000064	THAT IS JENNIFER KOTLER SHE'S ONE OF OUR EXPERT GUIDES TODAY THROUGH WHAT TURNS OUT TO BE A PRETTY COMPLICATED SUBJECT 
POD1000000010_S0000065	KINDNESS HAS BEEN A PART OF SESAME STREET FROM THE BEGINNING SO IT'S NOT A NEW CONCEPT BUT 
POD1000000010_S0000066	BUT SHE SAYS THE FOLKS AT SESAME AND LOTS OF CHILD DEVELOPMENT EXPERTS ARE STARTING TO NOTICE THINGS WARNINGS 
POD1000000010_S0000067	NOT ONLY IN THE HEADLINES BUT IN RESEARCH 
POD1000000010_S0000068	AND THAT BRINGS US TO OUR FIRST TAKEAWAY THAT PARENTS AND TEACHERS ARE SENDING KIDS REALLY MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT KINDNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000069	EXHIBIT A IS THIS STUDY JEN POINTS TO OUT OF HARVARD A FEW YEARS BACK 
POD1000000010_S0000070	MIDDLE-SCHOOL CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE THOUGHT THAT THEIR PARENTS VALUED ACADEMIC SUCCESS OVER KINDNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000071	IN FACT ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT OF CHILDREN BELIEVED THEIR PARENTS WERE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT GOOD GRADES AND THEIR KIDS CAREERS THAN WHETHER THEY WERE CARING TOWARDS OTHERS 
POD1000000010_S0000072	EIGHTY PERCENT AND THE PARENTS ON THE OTHER HAND THEY GOT SURVEYED TOO 
POD1000000010_S0000073	AND THEY DIDN'T REALIZE THIS THEY THEY WERE TOTALLY WRONG ABOUT THE MESSAGE THAT THEY THOUGHT THEIR KIDS WERE GETTING 
POD1000000010_S0000074	YEAH AND THIS KIND OF LIKE SELF-DELUSION THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY REASONS SCARLETT WORRIES THAT THIS CULTURE IS CREATING HUGE PROBLEMS 
POD1000000010_S0000075	NOW AT EPIDEMIC LEVELS 
POD1000000010_S0000076	AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT JUST SCHOOL VIOLENCE AND BULLYING AND LONELINESS BUT ALSO SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL ILLNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000077	AND OF COURSE HER LIFE IS A REALLY STARK REMINDER CORY OF JUST HOW HIGH THE STAKES CAN BE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THINGS LIKE MENTAL HEALTH AND KIDS WHO ARE TROUBLED 
POD1000000010_S0000078	SOMETIMES IT'S FRUSTRATING FOR ME BECAUSE WE ACT LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO 
POD1000000010_S0000079	AND WE DO KNOW WHAT TO DO 
POD1000000010_S0000080	AFTER SHE READ THAT MESSAGE FROM JESSE SCARLETT LEWIS REACHED OUT TO A TEAM OF RESEARCHERS AND EDUCATORS AND SHE CREATED A PLAN TO ESSENTIALLY TEACH CHILDREN KINDNESS STEP BY STEP VALUE BY VALUE 
POD1000000010_S0000081	YEAH THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM THEY ESTIMATE IT'S NOW REACHED OVER A MILLION STUDENTS 
POD1000000010_S0000082	IN FACT IN THE PAST DECADE OR SO SCHOOLS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HAVE WOKEN UP TO THE IDEA THAT THEY HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO TEACH KIDS HOW TO TREAT EACH OTHER 
POD1000000010_S0000083	YEAH AND NOT JUST TO PREVENT THE NEXT TRAGEDY BUT ALSO BECAUSE RESEARCH TELLS US THAT THESE NON-ACADEMIC SKILLS OFTEN CALLED SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SKILLS 
POD1000000010_S0000084	THEY MAKE UP ABOUT HALF OF THE EQUATION THAT DETERMINES WHETHER KIDS ARE GONNA BE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR LIVES 
POD1000000010_S0000085	SO LET'S FOLLOW SCARLETT'S LEAD AND SESAME STREET'S AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE SCIENCE OF KINDNESS CAN TRANSLATE INTO ACTION 
POD1000000010_S0000087	TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO 
POD1000000010_S0000088	KIDS ARE BORN TO BE KIND 
POD1000000010_S0000089	BUT ALSO UNKIND 
POD1000000010_S0000090	HERE'S WHAT WE MEAN 
POD1000000010_S0000091	SO ON THE ONE HAND PEOPLE HAVE NEURONS IN OUR BRAINS CALLED MIRROR NEURONS AND THEY RESPOND IN THE SAME WAY WHEN WE EXPERIENCE PAIN LIKE WE'RE PICKED BY A NEEDLE AS WE DO WHEN WE WATCH SOMEONE ELSE EXPERIENCE PAIN 
POD1000000010_S0000092	IT'S A MIRROR 
POD1000000010_S0000093	IT LIGHTS UP THE SAME RECEPTORS IN OUR BRAIN AS PHYSICAL PAIN 
POD1000000010_S0000094	SOON AFTER BIRTH CHILDREN FOR EXAMPLE WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO CRY AS A RESULT OF HEARING ANOTHER CHILD CRY THAN THEY ARE IN RESPONSE TO ANY OTHER SORT OF NOISE 
POD1000000010_S0000095	THOMAS LICKONA SAYS WE SEE SIGNS OF WHAT IS CALLED EMPATHIC DISTRESS EVEN IN TINY BABIES 
POD1000000010_S0000096	HE'S A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WROTE THE BOOK ON HOW TO RAISE KIND KIDS LITERALLY 
POD1000000010_S0000097	THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED HE'S ALSO BEEN A FAMILY COUNSELOR HAS TWO KIDS AND FIFTEEN GRANDKIDS 
POD1000000010_S0000098	AND TOM TOLD US THAT BABIES MORAL SENSE SEEMS TO GO EVEN DEEPER 
POD1000000010_S0000099	STUDIES GOING BACK TO THE LATE NINETEEN-NINETIES HAVE FOUND INFANTS AS YOUNG AS THREE MONTHS OLD PREFER A KIND OR HELPER PUPPET OVER A MEAN AGGRESSIVE CHARACTER 
POD1000000010_S0000100	SO THIS IS LIKE I WAS SAYING CORY I ALWAYS THOUGHT KIDS ARE JUST BORN TO BE KIND 
POD1000000010_S0000101	YEAH BUT THE PROBLEM FOR KIDS IS THAT THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF BARRIERS TO KINDNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000102	FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S A SMALL STUDY OF TWO-YEAR-OLDS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO ANOTHER CHILD'S DISTRESS SAY A FRIEND FELL DOWN ON THE PLAYGROUND 
POD1000000010_S0000103	ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF THE KIDS ACTUALLY RESPONDED IN THAT MOMENT WITH ALTRUISM WITH KINDNESS BY SAY GOING OVER TO THE CHILD OFFERING A HUG CALLING FOR AN ADULT 
POD1000000010_S0000104	ZACHARY 
POD1000000010_S0000106	LET'S CHECK ON HIM BELLA HE'S TRYING TO CHECK ON YOU 
POD1000000010_S0000107	HE'S TRYING TO HELP YOU UP 
POD1000000010_S0000108	YEAH AND WE ACTUALLY SAW THIS KIND OF SCENE IN-PERSON ON A RECENT TRIP THAT WE TOOK TO A PRESCHOOL ON THE CAMPUS OF EASTERN CONNECTICUT STATE UNIVERSITY 
POD1000000010_S0000109	I'M GONNA HELP BELLA 
POD1000000010_S0000110	OH GREAT LET'S SEE 
POD1000000010_S0000111	WHAT A KIND FRIEND 
POD1000000010_S0000112	LET ME HELP YOU BELLA 
POD1000000010_S0000114	AND IT REALLY GOT ME WONDERING WOULD MY KIDS BE THAT ONE IN THREE WOULD YOURS 
POD1000000010_S0000115	YEAH I DON'T KNOW I MEAN I REALLY HOPE SO 
POD1000000010_S0000116	BUT WHAT IS IT THAT GETS IN THE WAY OF THAT KINDNESS THAT ACT OF KINDNESS IN THE MOMENT 
POD1000000010_S0000117	A BUNCH OF THINGS 
POD1000000010_S0000118	AH YOUNG KIDS ARE NATURALLY SELF-CENTERED 
POD1000000010_S0000119	SURE 
POD1000000010_S0000120	EVERY PARENT KNOWS THAT 
POD1000000010_S0000121	AH SO THEY MIGHT JUST BE OBLIVIOUS TO ANOTHER CHILD'S PAIN 
POD1000000010_S0000122	YOU KNOW AND THERE'S ALSO INDIVIDUAL TEMPERAMENT RIGHT 
POD1000000010_S0000123	SO SOME KIDS 
POD1000000010_S0000124	THEY REALLY CAN'T HANDLE OTHER KIDS PAIN THEY THEY SHUT DOWN 
POD1000000010_S0000125	OR MAYBE THEY'RE REALLY SHY THEY'RE WAITING FOR SOMEONE ELSE TO STEP UP 
POD1000000010_S0000126	YOU KNOW DECADES OF PSYCHOLOGY RESEARCH TELLS US THIS IS A GROWN-UP PROBLEM TOO 
POD1000000010_S0000127	SOMETIMES THE PRESENCE OF OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY SERVES AS AN INHIBITION 
POD1000000010_S0000128	BUT THERE'S ALSO ANOTHER MORE DISTURBING BARRIER TO KINDNESS THAT ADULTS REALLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND HERE AND IT'S PREJUDICE 
POD1000000010_S0000129	SO THERE'S ANOTHER YALE STUDY OF SIX TO EIGHT-MONTH-OLD BABIES 
POD1000000010_S0000130	AH UM 
POD1000000010_S0000131	THEY WANTED A PUPPET THAT DID NOT SHARE THEIR SNACK PREFERENCE PUNISHED 
POD1000000010_S0000132	PUNISHED 
POD1000000010_S0000133	YEAH SO IT'S NOT JUST THAT THESE BABIES SHOWED A PREFERENCE FOR THOSE WHO LOOK OR BEHAVE OR THINK LIKE THEY DO BUT ALSO A KIND OF HOSTILITY TO THOSE THAT DON'T 
POD1000000010_S0000134	WOW 
POD1000000010_S0000135	YEAH SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS CHILDREN AND GROWN-UPS ALIKE DON'T ALWAYS REACH OUT TO HELP 
POD1000000010_S0000136	INSTEAD WE OFTEN DO THE OPPOSITE 
POD1000000010_S0000137	IT'S TRUE WE HIDE FROM OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN WE RUN AWAY FROM RESPONSIBILITY 
POD1000000010_S0000138	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS 
POD1000000010_S0000139	YOU DON'T REALLY NEED THE SKILLS AND TOOLS 
POD1000000010_S0000140	WHAT YOU NEED IS THE COURAGE TO BE WITH SOMEBODY IN PAIN AND JUST BE PRESENT 
POD1000000010_S0000142	AND THAT'S OUR THIRD TAKEAWAY 
POD1000000010_S0000143	KINDNESS REQUIRES COURAGE 
POD1000000010_S0000144	THE JESSE LEWIS CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM FOR KIDS FROM PRE-K THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL ACTUALLY BEGINS WITH COURAGE 
POD1000000010_S0000145	AND I WANNA MENTION THAT REPORTS OF THE SHOOTING SAID THAT JESSE HIMSELF SHOWED INCREDIBLE COURAGE 
POD1000000010_S0000146	WHEN THE SHOOTER STOPPED TO RELOAD HE YELLED RUN AND THE INVESTIGATORS SAID THAT HE SAVED MANY OF HIS CLASSMATES LIVES IN THAT MOMENT 
POD1000000010_S0000147	YEAH AND SCARLETT'S DEFINITION OF COURAGE IS EVEN BIGGER THAN THAT SORT OF 
POD1000000010_S0000149	COURAGE 
POD1000000010_S0000151	HEROIC COURAGE 
POD1000000010_S0000152	UM FOR HER IT INCLUDES THE COURAGE TO REACH OUT TO A HURTING FRIEND ON THE PLAYGROUND OR OR A CHILD YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW 
POD1000000010_S0000153	YEAH ABSOLUTELY I I MEAN THE COURAGE TO OFFER COMFORT TO SOMEONE WHO'S LOST A LOVED ONE EVEN IF THE IDEA OF DEATH IS REALLY SCARY TO YOU 
POD1000000010_S0000154	IT'S ALSO SCARLETT SAYS THE COURAGE TO STAND UP TO SOMEONE WHO'S BULLYING YOU OR SOMEONE YOU KNOW BY TAKING THEIR PERSPECTIVE AND SEEING THE WORLD THROUGH THEIR EYES 
POD1000000010_S0000155	GOSH YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU ACT THAT WAY 
POD1000000010_S0000156	WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE 
POD1000000010_S0000157	I FEEL COMPASSION FOR YOU 
POD1000000010_S0000158	AH AH I SEE THE PAIN 
POD1000000010_S0000159	IS THERE ANYTHING THAT I CAN DO TO HELP EASE THAT PAIN 
POD1000000010_S0000160	YOU KNOW HEARING ABOUT COURAGE IN THAT WAY IN THAT MOMENT REALLY SPOKE TO ME CORY BECAUSE I HAVE TO ADMIT THIS 
POD1000000010_S0000161	I WAS A LITTLE AFRAID TO SIT DOWN WITH SCARLETT 
POD1000000010_S0000162	I MEAN SOMEONE WHO HAD GONE THROUGH SOMETHING THAT I AS A PARENT FEAR SO MUCH AND TO LOOK THAT PAIN IN THE FACE 
POD1000000010_S0000163	BUT THE WAY THAT SHE HAS TRANSFORMED THAT EXPERIENCE INTO A POSITIVE LEGACY IS IS SO INSPIRING 
POD1000000010_S0000165	ONE REALLY PRACTICAL WAY SCARLETT'S CHOOSE LOVE PLAN BUILDS COURAGE IS BY TEACHING KIDS TO STAY CALM 
POD1000000010_S0000166	THEY PRACTICE BRAVE POSES AND BRAVE BREATHS TO STAND UP TALL LIKE SUPERHEROES AND CALM DOWN THEIR BODIES AND THEIR MINDS 
POD1000000010_S0000167	YEAH THERE ARE FEW DIFFERENT REASONS FOR THIS WHICH MAKE UP OUR FOURTH TAKEAWAY 
POD1000000010_S0000168	YEAH TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR 
POD1000000010_S0000169	KINDNESS TAKES MINDFULNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000170	JEN KOTLER AT SESAME SAYS IF YOU'RE MORE AWARE OF YOUR EMOTIONS YOU'LL ALSO BE MORE AWARE OF EVERYONE ELSE'S 
POD1000000010_S0000171	AND YOU'LL BE LESS LIKELY TO LASH OUT VIOLENTLY IN FRUSTRATION OR ANGER 
POD1000000010_S0000172	SELF-REGULATION IS SOMETHING WE ALL STRUGGLE WITH 
POD1000000010_S0000173	AND THAT'S WHY MINDFULNESS IS SO IMPORTANT AND REALLY LEARNING HOW TO MANAGE OUR OWN EMOTIONS 
POD1000000010_S0000174	AND I THINK THE EARLIER THAT WE CAN PRACTICE THOSE SKILLS THE BETTER WE'LL BE IN ADULTHOOD 
POD1000000010_S0000175	IN FACT THE FOLKS AT SESAME ARE SO CONVINCED OF THE CONNECTION BETWEEN MINDFULNESS AND KINDNESS THAT THEY LIKE TO USE A SPECIAL WORD KINDFULNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000176	YOU HEAR THAT MERRIAM-WEBSTER 
POD1000000010_S0000178	ANYWAY LOTS OF THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL LEARNING PROGRAMS INTRODUCE TOOLS LIKE MEDITATION RELAXATION YOGA TO HELP KIDS WORK ON THIS BODY-MIND CONNECTION 
POD1000000010_S0000179	SO WE TALKED ABOUT THE COURAGE THAT IT TAKES TO STEP IN WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS HURTING EVEN IF THAT PERSON IS BEING HURTFUL TOWARDS YOU 
POD1000000010_S0000180	AND HOW TO CULTIVATE THAT QUIET IN YOUR MIND THAT LETS YOU DO THAT 
POD1000000010_S0000181	OUR NEXT TAKEAWAY IS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WHEN YOUR CHILD HURTS SOMEONE ELSE ACCIDENTALLY OR INTENTIONALLY 
POD1000000010_S0000182	OR ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN SOMEONE ELSE HURTS YOUR CHILD 
POD1000000010_S0000183	TAKEAWAY NUMBER FIVE 
POD1000000010_S0000184	APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL 
POD1000000010_S0000185	AND FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF 
POD1000000010_S0000186	YEAH BEFORE JEN STARTED AT SESAME WORKSHOP SHE SPENT HER DAYS IN A CLASSROOM 
POD1000000010_S0000187	I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS A PRESCHOOL TEACHER BRIEFLY THAT WE WERE TOLD WE DON'T FORCE CHILDREN TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER 
POD1000000010_S0000188	AND I REMEMBER IN MY EARLY TWENTIES THINKING THAT'S ABSURD 
POD1000000010_S0000189	YOU SHOULD TOTALLY TELL CHILDREN TO APOLOGIZE TO EACH OTHER 
POD1000000010_S0000190	THE PROBLEM JEN FOUND OUT WITH FORCED APOLOGIES AS THAT THEY'RE USUALLY PRETTY WORTHLESS 
POD1000000010_S0000191	SORRY 
POD1000000010_S0000192	THEY DON'T EVEN REALIZE THAT THAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO MEAN IT YOU KNOW OR FEEL IT 
POD1000000010_S0000193	YEAH SO TOM LICKONA AND JEN KOTLER BOTH TOLD US INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON KIDS PARROTING THE WORDS SORRY 
POD1000000010_S0000194	WE SHOULD HELP THEM REALLY TAKE THE OTHER PERSON'S PERSPECTIVE AND THIS IS IMPORTANT REPAIR THE HARM DONE 
POD1000000010_S0000195	YEAH AND THIS IS A GREAT TIP 
POD1000000010_S0000196	JEN SAYS YOU CAN ACTUALLY TAKE A MOMENT LIKE THIS 
POD1000000010_S0000197	AND DIRECT ONE CHILD TO LOOK AT THE OTHER CHILD'S FACE AND POSTURE 
POD1000000010_S0000198	AND THIS HELPS THEM LEARN HOW TO READ FEELINGS 
POD1000000010_S0000199	SO IT'S REALLY ABOUT MORE CONVERSATIONS AND ABOUT LOOKING AT EMOTIONS AND EMOTION KNOWLEDGE AND LOOKING AT FACES TO SEE HOW YOUR ACTIONS AFFECT OTHER PEOPLE 
POD1000000010_S0000200	JEN SAYS SESAME STREET HAS IMPROVED OVER TIME IN HOW IT DEPICTS APOLOGIES ON THE SHOW 
POD1000000010_S0000201	IT NOW HAS CHARACTERS DISCUSS WHAT WENT WRONG AND WHY AND HOW TO MAKE IT BETTER 
POD1000000010_S0000202	SO ELMO MIGHT SAY I WAS REALLY WANTING TO PLAY WITH MY SCOOTER AND I DIDN'T WANT TO SHARE IT 
POD1000000010_S0000203	AND I REALIZED THAT YOU PROBABLY WANTED A TURN TOO 
POD1000000010_S0000204	AND I SHOULD LET YOU HAVE THE TIME WITH IT 
POD1000000010_S0000206	YOU'LL GET IT ZOE 
POD1000000010_S0000207	BUT BUT BUT WAIT WHAT ABOUT YOUR TURN ELMO 
POD1000000010_S0000208	ELMO ELMO CAN BE PATIENT AND WAIT FOR HIS TURN 
POD1000000010_S0000209	SO WHAT DO YOU SAY ZOE 
POD1000000010_S0000210	AND THEN THE OTHER CHARACTER WOULD SAY YES THAT'S HOW I WAS FEELING THAT YOU WEREN'T SHARING 
POD1000000010_S0000211	AND IT WAS HURTING MY FEELINGS AND THEN WHEN YOU SHARED IT MADE ME FEEL BETTER 
POD1000000010_S0000212	YEAH 
POD1000000010_S0000214	ALL RIGHT NICE JOB SHARING ELMO 
POD1000000010_S0000215	ALL RIGHT THANKS 
POD1000000010_S0000216	SO IN THAT INTERACTION YOU'RE GIVING CHILDREN A LOT OF LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY'RE FEELING 
POD1000000010_S0000217	THAT MAY BE A LOT TO EXPECT FROM A TWO-YEAR-OLD 
POD1000000010_S0000218	BUT YOU KNOW APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL KIND OF LIKE LEARNING TO SCOOTER 
POD1000000010_S0000219	AND THEY IMPROVE WITH PRACTICE 
POD1000000010_S0000220	YEAH AND STARTING THESE KINDS OF CONVERSATIONS EARLY IS CRUCIAL TO RAISING A CHILD WHO RUNS TO HELP WHEN SOMEBODY'S HURT 
POD1000000010_S0000221	SO REMEMBER THAT SMALL STUDY WE MENTIONED OF KIDS ON THE PLAYGROUND 
POD1000000010_S0000222	WELL IT ALSO LOOKED IN-DEPTH AT THE PARENTING STYLES OF THEIR MOTHERS IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
POD1000000010_S0000223	WHEN ONE CHILD HURT ANOTHER MANY OF THE MOTHERS RESPONDED WITH SOMETHING CASUAL AND BLAND 
POD1000000010_S0000224	YEAH LIKE OH DON'T DO THAT 
POD1000000010_S0000225	BUT THE RESEARCHERS FOUND THAT THE MOMS OF THE HELPER KIDS THOSE ONE IN THREE WHO RAN TO HELP THEY WERE DIFFERENT 
POD1000000010_S0000226	YEAH THEY WERE WARM AND NURTURING BUT THEY ALSO TOOK IT REALLY SERIOUSLY WHEN THEIR CHILD HURT ANOTHER CHILD 
POD1000000010_S0000227	SO THEY'D SAY SOMETHING LIKE 
POD1000000010_S0000228	YOU HURT AMY 
POD1000000010_S0000229	PULLING HAIR HURTS NEVER PULL HAIR 
POD1000000010_S0000230	AND AS A RESULT THE CHILD WAS MORE LIKELY TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY LATER ON AND RESPOND COMPASSIONATELY WHEN SHE SAW ANOTHER CHILD CRYING ON THE PLAYGROUND 
POD1000000010_S0000231	TOM ALSO SAYS THAT CHILDREN SHOULD LEARN TO MAKE AN APOLOGY OF ACTION 
POD1000000010_S0000232	WHAT WE GROWN-UPS MIGHT CALL RESTITUTION IF YOU BREAK SOMETHING YOU FIX IT WHETHER IT'S A BROKEN TOY OR A HURT FEELING 
POD1000000010_S0000233	THIS IS ALSO WHERE THINGS GET HARD FOR US GROWN-UPS TOO 
POD1000000010_S0000234	YEAH 
POD1000000010_S0000235	BECAUSE ALL THE EXPERTS WE SPOKE WITH WERE REALLY CLEAR KIDS DO WHAT THEY SEE 
POD1000000010_S0000236	AND SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS THAT MEANS WHEN PARENTS SCREW UP WE NEED TO APOLOGIZE TOO 
POD1000000010_S0000237	WOW MOM MADE A MISTAKE YOU KNOW 
POD1000000010_S0000238	AH AND I MISINTERPRETED WHAT JUST HAPPENED HERE 
POD1000000010_S0000239	AND I GOT ANGRY I'M SORRY YOU KNOW CAN YOU GUYS FORGIVE ME 
POD1000000010_S0000240	IF ANYTHING SCARLETT TALKS EVEN MORE ABOUT THE OTHER SIDE OF AN APOLOGY FORGIVENESS 
POD1000000010_S0000241	THAT'S ONE OF THE FOUR CORE VALUES OF HER CHOOSE LOVE PROGRAM ALONG WITH COURAGE 
POD1000000010_S0000242	AND SHE SAYS WHEN SHE FIRST PITCHED THE PROGRAM PEOPLE WEREN'T SURE ABOUT FORGIVENESS 
POD1000000010_S0000243	THAT'S A VERY LOFTY TOPIC FOR KIDS 
POD1000000010_S0000244	DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A LITTLE TOO COMPLICATED 
POD1000000010_S0000245	NOT AT ALL SHE SAYS 
POD1000000010_S0000246	THE CHOOSE LOVE CLASSROOMS HAVE TURNED FORGIVENESS INTO A HANDS-ON EXERCISE 
POD1000000010_S0000247	WE LITERALLY TAKE STRING AND SCISSORS AND WE CUT THE CORD UM BECAUSE THAT'S HOW I TALK ABOUT IT 
POD1000000010_S0000248	LIKE IF YOU'RE ANGRY AT SOMEBODY YOU'RE ATTACHED TO THEM WITH AN UMBILICAL CORD 
POD1000000010_S0000249	AND IT RUNS OUT OF YOUR SIDE INTO THE SIDE OF THE PERSON THAT YOU'RE ANGRY AT 
POD1000000010_S0000250	I LOVE THIS TOO BECAUSE SCARLETT IS REALLY FOCUSING ON THE BENEFIT OF LETTING GO OF ANGER 
POD1000000010_S0000251	AND SHE SAYS YOU KNOW HOLDING ONTO ANGER IT CAN BE AS BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH AS SMOKING CIGARETTES 
POD1000000010_S0000252	AND IT WAS AT THIS POINT WHERE SITTING WITH SCARLETT IN HER KITCHEN HER BACK IS TO HER REFRIGERATOR WHICH IS COVERED WITH PHOTOS OF JESSE AND HER OTHER SON J T AND WE JUST HAD TO ASK 
POD1000000010_S0000253	WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT FORGIVENESS 
POD1000000010_S0000254	DID SHE FORGIVE THE PERSON WHO MURDERED HER SON 
POD1000000010_S0000255	ABSOLUTELY 
POD1000000010_S0000257	WITHOUT HESITATION YEAH I I WITHOUT HESITATION I ABSOLUTELY FORGIVE HIM 
POD1000000010_S0000259	SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT KINDNESS IN THE DARKEST HOURS THOSE MOMENTS OF CONFLICT 
POD1000000010_S0000260	LOSS AND PAIN HURT AND ANGER 
POD1000000010_S0000261	AND THOSE ARE REALLY IMPORTANT 
POD1000000010_S0000262	I MEAN THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY NEED KINDNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000263	YEAH BUT HOW DO YOU BUILD KINDNESS UP 
POD1000000010_S0000264	WELL IF YOU WANT TO REALLY GROW KIND PEOPLE THERE'S A LOT YOU CAN DO WHEN THINGS ARE GOOD WHEN YOU ARE FULL OF JOY 
POD1000000010_S0000265	THAT'S OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX KINDNESS GROWS WITH SUNLIGHT 
POD1000000010_S0000266	WHAT DO WE MEAN BY THAT 
POD1000000010_S0000267	YOU HAVE THE RAISE THE CAPITAL OF KINDNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000268	AIJA SIMMONS HELPS RUN THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL PROGRAMS FOR SCHOOLS IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA 
POD1000000010_S0000269	AND SHE FOCUSED A LOT ON KINDNESS WHEN SHE TAUGHT ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
POD1000000010_S0000270	YOU HAVE TO POINT IT OUT 
POD1000000010_S0000271	YOU HAVE TO NAME IT 
POD1000000010_S0000272	YOU HAVE TO APPRECIATE IT WHEN YOU SEE IT 
POD1000000010_S0000273	FOR EXAMPLE EVERY DAY SHE'D HOLD CIRCLE TIME 
POD1000000010_S0000274	AND A LOT OF TIMES SHE'D ASK THIS 
POD1000000010_S0000275	YOU KNOW WHAT WERE SOME WAYS THIS WEEK WHERE YOUR CLASSMATES WERE KIND TO YOU 
POD1000000010_S0000276	TURN AND SHARE A MOMENT WHERE YOU FELT SOMEONE WAS BEING REALLY KIND 
POD1000000010_S0000277	TOM LICKONA SAYS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CELEBRATING KIND ACTIONS 
POD1000000010_S0000278	IT'S ENCOURAGING KIDS TO IDENTIFY AS KIND PEOPLE 
POD1000000010_S0000279	YEAH BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE KIND IF THEY SEE IT AS PART OF WHO THEY ARE 
POD1000000010_S0000280	YEAH THIS IDEA OF TAKING SPECIAL NOTICE WHEN PEOPLE ARE KIND TO YOU WELL ANOTHER WORD FOR THAT COULD BE GRATITUDE 
POD1000000010_S0000281	YEAH PART OF HOW SCARLETT KEEPS GOING SHE TOLD US IS BY CONSTANTLY REMINDING HERSELF EVEN OUT LOUD WHAT SHE'S GRATEFUL FOR 
POD1000000010_S0000282	MY GRATITUDE LISTS ARE ALL DAY LONG 
POD1000000010_S0000283	AND I START IN THE MORNING BY TICKING OFF AH THE SUN'S OUT AND AH I CAN GET UP OUT OF BED AND LITERALLY LIKE I'M TICKING THEM OFF ALL DAY 
POD1000000010_S0000284	UM AND WHEN YOU'RE FOCUSED ON GRATITUDE YOU'RE NOT FOCUSED ON THE LESSER-ENERGY THOUGHTS 
POD1000000010_S0000285	AND TOM AGREES 
POD1000000010_S0000286	THERE'S A PAYOFF TO PRACTICING GRATITUDE IN THIS WAY 
POD1000000010_S0000287	NOT ONLY CAN RAISE THE STOCK OF KINDNESS IN YOUR FAMILY IN YOUR CLASSROOM BUT RESEARCH SHOWS THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE THANKFUL ARE ALSO HAPPIER 
POD1000000010_S0000288	YEAH HE SUGGESTS THAT AT MEALTIMES FOR EXAMPLE FAMILIES GO AROUND AND MENTION THEIR GRATEFULS-THINGS THAT THEY'RE THANKFUL FOR THAT DAY 
POD1000000010_S0000289	YEAH WE DO THIS IN MY HOUSE 
POD1000000010_S0000291	ALL RIGHT WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST 
POD1000000010_S0000292	ME UM I'M THANKFUL FOR ANIMALS AND PANDAS

POD1000000010_S0000298	BUT WE DO IT 
POD1000000010_S0000299	THE POINT OF ALL THIS IS TO REALLY CARVE OUT A TIME IN EACH DAY FOR YOUR KIDS AND YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT SELF-SUFFICIENT 
POD1000000010_S0000300	AH WE'RE NOT ISLANDS 
POD1000000010_S0000301	WE NEED OTHER PEOPLE AND OTHER PEOPLE NEED US 
POD1000000010_S0000302	THAT'S A GREAT POINT CORY I'VE GOT TO TRY THAT 
POD1000000010_S0000304	WE'VE COME TO OUR FINAL TAKEAWAY TAKEAWAY NUMBER SEVEN KINDNESS REQUIRES 
POD1000000010_S0000305	PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE 
POD1000000010_S0000306	YEAH IN FACT SCARLETT LEWIS SAYS 
POD1000000010_S0000307	WE WERE GONNA CHANGE THE NAME OF OUR PROGRAM FROM CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PROGRAM TO CHOOSE LOVE ENRICHMENT PRACTICE 
POD1000000010_S0000308	AND SIMILARLY TOM SAYS KINDNESS AS A VIRTUE ISN'T RANDOM IT'S A HABIT 
POD1000000010_S0000309	AND THAT'S NOT JUST CALLING OUT KINDNESS WHEN YOU SEE IT IN YOUR KIDS 
POD1000000010_S0000310	IT'S GIVING THEM LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO BE KIND YOU KNOW 
POD1000000010_S0000311	AND YOU CAN START WITH CHORES AT HOME 
POD1000000010_S0000312	CHORES YEAH THAT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA 
POD1000000010_S0000313	SO TOM SAYS YOU KNOW NOT FOR AN ALLOWANCE BUT JUST TO GIVE THE MESSAGE THAT THIS IS WHAT WE DO TO HELP OUT BECAUSE WE'RE PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER 
POD1000000010_S0000314	AND FOR MY DAUGHTER LULU WHO'S SEVEN THAT CHORE AH REALLY IS TAKING CARE OF THE CAT 
POD1000000010_S0000315	YOU KNOW WHEN WE GOT THE CAT SHE PROMISED THAT SHE WOULD HELP OUT NOT ONLY WITH THE FEEDING BUT ALSO THE LITTER BOX 
POD1000000010_S0000316	THIS IS REALLY GIVING HER THE MESSAGE THAT THERE'S ANOTHER CREATURE DEPENDING ON HER 
POD1000000010_S0000317	YEAH TOTALLY 
POD1000000010_S0000318	AND YOU CAN ALSO AND SHOULD YOU KNOW TAKE THIS MODEL THIS IDEA AND TAKE IT OUT INTO YOUR COMMUNITY 
POD1000000010_S0000319	YOU KNOW HAVE YOUR KIDS HELP PICK UP TRASH IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR HELP FOLKS AT A SHELTER 
POD1000000010_S0000320	RAISE MONEY FOR A GOOD CAUSE WHATEVER IT IS 
POD1000000010_S0000322	AND HERE'S THE REALLY GOOD NEWS TOM TOLD US 
POD1000000010_S0000323	GETTING OUR KIDS TO BE HELPERS TO BE IN SERVICE IT DOESN'T JUST BENEFIT THE GROWN-UPS THAT THEY BECOME 
POD1000000010_S0000324	DOING THIS REGULARLY ACTUALLY FEELS GOOD CHEMICALLY 
POD1000000010_S0000325	IT'S WHAT BRAIN RESEARCHERS CALL HELPER'S HIGH 
POD1000000010_S0000326	DOING A KIND ACT LIGHTS UP A PART OF THE BRAIN THAT LET'S US EXPERIENCE JOY 
POD1000000010_S0000327	AND THAT'S WHY HE SAYS WE'RE HAPPIER WHEN WE'RE HELPING AND JEN AT SESAME AGREES 
POD1000000010_S0000328	KINDNESS REALLY DOES MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD 
POD1000000010_S0000329	AND THAT'S WHY SCARLETT SAYS WE SHOULD TALK TO KIDS DIRECTLY ABOUT THIS HELPER'S HIGH 
POD1000000010_S0000330	THERE'S SO MUCH SCIENCE THAT SHOWS AND I SAY ALL THE NURTURING HEALING LOVE THAT YOU GIVE OUT YOU GET BACK 
POD1000000010_S0000331	SO THIS IS GETTING ME THINKING MORE ABOUT THAT STUDY OF MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS THAT WE OPENED THE EPISODE WITH 
POD1000000010_S0000332	UM AH 
POD1000000010_S0000333	YOU KNOW OUR KIDS THEY HEAR FROM US EVERY DAY DO YOUR HOMEWORK 
POD1000000010_S0000334	STUDY FOR THE TEST 
POD1000000010_S0000335	HOW WELL DID YOU DO 
POD1000000010_S0000336	AND THEY HEAR US TALK ABOUT SWEATING SOME PROMOTION OR WORKING HARD ON A PROJECT 
POD1000000010_S0000337	BUT YOU KNOW DO WE EVER STOP AND ASK THEM WERE YOU KIND IN CLASS TODAY 
POD1000000010_S0000338	YEAH DID YOU HELP SOMEBODY WHO WAS HURTING OR SIT BY THAT KID WHO ALWAYS EATS ALONE 
POD1000000010_S0000339	IT'S NO WONDER OUR KIDS SO OFTEN THINK THAT WE VALUE GRADES MORE THAN KINDNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000340	SO I'M THINKING MORE ABOUT HOW TO RAISE THE CAPITAL OF KINDNESS AT HOME 
POD1000000010_S0000341	AND WE'VE GONE THROUGH THESE GREAT STRATEGIES RIGHT 
POD1000000010_S0000342	YEAH YEAH I MEAN THE THE GOAL HERE EVERYONE WE TALKED TO SAID THIS SAID THIS WORD 
POD1000000010_S0000343	THEY USED THE WORD CULTURE 
POD1000000010_S0000344	YOU HAVE TO CREATE A CULTURE OF KINDNESS WHETHER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HOME OR THE CLASSROOM OR ANYWHERE 
POD1000000010_S0000346	TIME FOR A RECAP ANYA 
POD1000000010_S0000347	ALL RIGHT I'M FEELING LOVE LET'S DO IT

POD1000000010_S0000350	WE GROWN-UPS SEEM TO STOP SENDING OUR KIDS MIXED MESSAGES ABOUT KINDNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000351	YEAH WE SAY WE WANT OUR KIDS TO BE KIND BUT WE HAVE GOT TO WALK THE WALK 
POD1000000010_S0000352	TAKEAWAY NUMBER TWO KIDS ARE BORN TO BE KIND BUT ALSO UNKIND 
POD1000000010_S0000353	YEAH SO EMPATHY IS PART OF WHAT MAKES US HUMAN BUT AND THIS IS A BIG BUT 
POD1000000010_S0000354	THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FEELING SOMEONE ELSE'S PAIN AND ACTUALLY ACTING TO HELP 
POD1000000010_S0000355	YEAH KINDNESS IS NOT JUST A FEELING IT'S AN ACTION 
POD1000000010_S0000356	AND THAT'S WHY OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER THREE IS KINDNESS REQUIRES COURAGE 
POD1000000010_S0000357	THE COURAGE TO EMBRACE OTHER PEOPLE'S PAIN THE COURAGE TO PUT OTHER PEOPLE'S NEEDS BEFORE YOUR OWN 
POD1000000010_S0000358	BUT ALSO COURAGE TO SEE SOMEONE WHO'S HURT YOU OR A FRIEND OR SOMEONE IN YOUR FAMILY NOT AS A BULLY 
POD1000000010_S0000359	BUT AS SOMEONE WHO'S STRUGGLING 
POD1000000010_S0000360	THE KIND OF COURAGE TO SEE THE WORLD THE WAY SCARLETT LEWIS DOES 
POD1000000010_S0000361	THERE ARE ONLY TWO KINDS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD GOOD PEOPLE AND GOOD PEOPLE IN PAIN 
POD1000000010_S0000362	TAKEAWAY NUMBER FOUR TO BUILD KINDNESS PRACTICE MINDFULNESS 
POD1000000010_S0000363	BEING ABLE TO STAY CALM AND PATIENT WILL HELP YOU EVERY TIME 
POD1000000010_S0000364	ESPECIALLY WHEN SOMEONE HURTS YOU 
POD1000000010_S0000365	SO TAKEAWAY NUMBER FIVE IS APOLOGIES ARE A SKILL AND FORGIVENESS IS A GIFT YOU GIVE YOURSELF 
POD1000000010_S0000366	REMEMBER PARENTS AND TEACHERS ALIKE THE OLD SINGSONGY SORRY IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
POD1000000010_S0000367	AND WHEN YOU'RE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HARM FORGIVENESS MAY FEEL HARD BUT IT WILL ALSO FEEL GOOD IN THE LONG RUN 
POD1000000010_S0000368	SPEAKING OF FEELING GOOD OUR TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX IS KINDNESS GROWS WITH SUNLIGHT 
POD1000000010_S0000369	OR AS JEN AT SESAME SAYS 
POD1000000010_S0000370	WE OFTEN ARE QUICK TO TELL CHILDREN WHEN THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING WRONG AND TRYING TO CORRECT THEM FROM DOING SOMETHING WRONG 
POD1000000010_S0000371	INSTEAD CAN WE SPEND MORE TIME CATCHING THEM DOING SOMETHING RIGHT CATCHING THEM DOING SOMETHING KIND 
POD1000000010_S0000372	SO CREATE A CULTURE OF KINDNESS AND GRATITUDE RECOGNITION OF KINDNESS IN YOUR HOME AND IN YOUR CLASSROOM 
POD1000000010_S0000373	AND TAKEAWAY NUMBER SIX KINDNESS TAKES PRACTICE

POD1000000014_S0000009	HE THEN BECAME PUBLIC SERVICE OMBUDSMAN FOR WALES BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND THIRTEEN 
POD1000000014_S0000010	HE'S BEEN CHAIRMAN OF THE BRITISH AND IRISH OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION FOR TWO YEARS AND CURRENTLY HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE WORLD BOARD OF THE INTERNATIONAL OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTE FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS 
POD1000000014_S0000011	PETER YOU'RE EXTREMELY WELCOME THANK YOU FOR BEING WITH US 
POD1000000014_S0000012	THANK YOU ROB VERY GLAD TO BE HERE 
POD1000000014_S0000013	PETER UM I'M VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR A BIT ABOUT YOUR EARLY LIFE 
POD1000000014_S0000014	WHERE WERE YOU BORN AND TELL US A BIT ABOUT THE VALUES THAT WERE INSTILLED IN YOU WHEN YOU GREW UP 
POD1000000014_S0000015	UM THANK YOU ROB I WAS BORN IN DUBLIN I WAS BORN INTO A FAIRLY ORDINARY WORKING-CLASS HOME 
POD1000000014_S0000016	MY DAD WAS A UM MECHANIC WITH THE STATE TRANSPORT COMPANY MY MOTHER WAS UM AS WAS THE CASE WITH MANY IN THE DAY A HOUSEWIFE 
POD1000000014_S0000017	WE LIVED A VERY ORDINARY FAMILY LIFE 
POD1000000014_S0000018	I DIDN'T ENJOY SCHOOL AND I WAS TAUGHT BY THE CHRISTIAN BROTHERS SO I HAVE SOME OF MY LEARNING TO THANK THEM FOR 
POD1000000014_S0000019	WAS AH I WOULDN'T SAY THEY CONTRIBUTED TO A A VERY HAPPY SCHOOLDAYS BUT THE REST OF MY CHILDHOOD WAS VERY ENJOYABLE SO 
POD1000000014_S0000020	MY MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN QUITE RELIGIOUS IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT IRELAND AT THE TIME 
POD1000000014_S0000021	OUR HOUSE WAS BUSY THERE WERE OFTEN RELATIVES OR NEIGHBOURS POPPING IN FOR CUPS OF TEA 
POD1000000014_S0000022	AND SO WAS A A PLEASANT PLACE TO GROW UP 
POD1000000014_S0000023	SO YOU HAD A COMMUNITY SERVICE BACKGROUND BEFORE GOING TO WORK IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS THAT'S THAT'S CORRECT ISN'T IT 
POD1000000014_S0000024	YES SO I I WORKED FOR THE WELSH HOUSING AGENCY WHEN IT WAS SET UP THAT WAS FUNDING HOUSING ASSOCIATIONS ON SPECIAL NEEDS HOUSING 
POD1000000014_S0000025	BUT THEN I WENT TO WORK FOR CARDIFF HOUSING DEPARTMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000026	I WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SERVICES LIKE HOMELESSNESS AND SHELTERED HOUSING FOR OLDER PEOPLE AND SO ON 
POD1000000014_S0000027	AND ALSO MANAGED THE GYPSY SITES IN CARDIFF SO VERY INTERESTING JOB 
POD1000000014_S0000028	BUT I GRADUALLY BECAME MORE INVOLVED IN MAINSTREAM HOUSING THROUGH THAT 
POD1000000014_S0000029	AND THEN BEFORE YOU BECAME WELSH OMBUDSMAN YOU WERE YOU WERE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF THE ARTS COUNCIL OF WALES WAS WAS THAT GOOD FUN 
POD1000000014_S0000030	IT WAS VERY GOOD FUN IT WAS AT A TIME SHORTLY AFTER THE CREATION OF THE WELSH ASSEMBLY 
POD1000000014_S0000031	THE GOVERNMENT IN WALES WAS INTERESTED IN NATION-BUILDING IF YOU LIKE DOING THINGS TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER AND THEY SAW THE ARTS AS A VALUABLE WAY OF DOING THAT 
POD1000000014_S0000032	FROM MY PERSPECTIVE OBVIOUSLY I WAS ALSO INTERESTED IN COMMUNITY ARTS AND ARTS OUTREACH TO PEOPLE WHO WERE OTHERWISE EXCLUDED 
POD1000000014_S0000033	SO IT FITTED VERY WELL FOR ME I I NEVER HAD ANY EXPERTISE IN THE ARTS BUT I GREATLY ENJOYED IT 
POD1000000014_S0000034	AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD TIME FOR THE ARTS IN WALES 
POD1000000014_S0000035	NOW I THINK YOU MUST BE ONE OF THE VERY FEW PEOPLE TO HAVE OCCUPIED NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN JOBS IN MORE THAN ONE COUNTRY 
POD1000000014_S0000036	I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THERE'S ANYONE ELSE LIKE YOU IN THAT REGARD BUT WHAT WAS IT LIKE MOVING FROM BEING OMBUDSMAN IN WALES TO OMBUDSMAN IN IN IRELAND 
POD1000000014_S0000037	IT WAS INTERESTING 
POD1000000014_S0000038	I THINK THE OMBUDSMAN IN WALES WAS A VERY SIGNIFICANT PLAYER IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE DEVOLVED ADMINISTRATION IN WALES 
POD1000000014_S0000039	UM BUT PARTICULARLY THE WORK FOCUSED WITHIN THE HEALTH SPHERE 
POD1000000014_S0000040	AND AN AWFUL LOT OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE DEALT WITH WERE TO DO WITH CLINICAL JUDGEMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000041	SO MOVING TO IRELAND AND FIRSTLY I FOUND THAT I DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION OVER CLINICAL JUDGEMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000042	BUT ALSO I HAVE JURISDICTION OVER A MUCH BROADER RANGE OF GOVERNMENT SERVICES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000043	SO WAS SIMILAR IN SOME WAYS TO WALES BUT IT WAS A A BIGGER JOB IF YOU LIKE 
POD1000000014_S0000044	IN THE CONTEXT OF THE A UM WHOLE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT AND A DIFFERENT SET OF ISSUES TO DEAL WITH 
POD1000000014_S0000045	IN IRELAND YOU'RE ALSO YOU WEAR MANY HATS YOU'RE ALSO THE INFORMATION COMMISSIONER 
POD1000000014_S0000046	AND YOU DEAL WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AH STANDARDS AS WELL 
POD1000000014_S0000047	IS IS THAT DO YOU FIND THAT AN ADVANTAGE IN TERMS OF BEING OMBUDSMAN 
POD1000000014_S0000048	IT'S VERY HELPFUL IF YOU'RE COMMITTED TO THE SAME KINDS OF PRINCIPLES YOU'RE COMMITTED TO GOOD PUBLIC SERVICES YOU'RE COMMITTED TO OPENNESS YOU'RE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY 
POD1000000014_S0000049	THOSE VALUES WORK ACROSS ALL OF THE DIFFERENT HATS I WEAR 
POD1000000014_S0000050	I SUPPOSE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS AS OMBUDSMAN YOU MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IN IRELAND IN THE HISTORY OF THE OFFICE THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN IMPLEMENTED 
POD1000000014_S0000051	AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER YOU MAKE BINDING DECISIONS BUT THOSE GET CHALLENGED IN THE COURTS 
POD1000000014_S0000052	SO DESPITE WHAT MANY PEOPLE THINK TO BE THE CASE BEING AN OMBUDSMAN IN SOME WAYS IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN TERMS OF HAVING OUTCOMES ACHIEVED THAN HAVING BINDING POWERS AS INFORMATION COMMISSIONER 
POD1000000014_S0000053	WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES TO YOU AS IRISH OMBUDSMAN 
POD1000000014_S0000054	YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY SUCCESSFULLY DEALT WITH THEM BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN REAPPOINTED FOR A SECOND TERM BUT LOOKING BACK ON THE SIX YEARS THAT YOU'VE HAD WHAT WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES 
POD1000000014_S0000055	THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE FACED WAS WITH THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE MAGDALENE LAUNDRIES 
POD1000000014_S0000056	AS WE LOOKED MORE CLOSELY AT THE ISSUES THERE THIS WAS ABOUT WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL 
POD1000000014_S0000057	OFTEN YOUNG WOMEN WHO'D HAD BABIES SOMETIMES SCHOOLCHILDREN WHO'D BEEN HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL AND FORCED TO WORK FOR MANY YEARS IN LAUNDRIES 
POD1000000014_S0000058	WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT WAS A GOVERNMENT COMPENSATION SCHEME AND THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAD CHOSEN TO INTERPRET THAT SCHEME VERY NARROWLY 
POD1000000014_S0000059	SO THEY WERE EXCLUDING YOUNG WOMEN PEOPLE WHO AT THE TIME WERE YOUNG WOMEN AND HAD WORKED IN THE LAUNDRIES BUT BEEN DETAINED IN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS 
POD1000000014_S0000060	WHICH SHARED THE SAME SITES AS THE LAUNDRIES BUT NOT TECHNICALLY RESIDENT IN THE LAUNDRIES 
POD1000000014_S0000061	SO WE LOOKED AT THAT AND FELT THAT THERE WAS A HUGE INJUSTICE BUT THE INITIAL RESPONSE OF THE DEPARTMENT WAS TO REJECT OUR FINDINGS 
POD1000000014_S0000062	SO THAT REQUIRED A HIGH-PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN WHICH ULTIMATELY LED TO THE GOVERNMENT CHANGING ITS MIND 
POD1000000014_S0000063	TO BE FAIR I SUSPECT IF MINISTERS HAD BEEN INVOLVED FROM THE OUTSET I DON'T THINK THAT THE REJECTION WE INITIALLY SAW WOULD HAVE HAPPENED 
POD1000000014_S0000064	DID ANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO UM EXPERIENCED THIS DETRIMENT GET IN TOUCH WITH YOU OR WAS THIS THE NATURE OF YOU SEEING THE UNFAIRNESS AND ACTING ON THEIR BEHALF 
POD1000000014_S0000065	NO WE HAD A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES BUT WE INVESTIGATED THE WHOLE SCHEME AND SO SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO BENEFITED WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE KNOWN OF MY OFFICE 
POD1000000014_S0000066	SO THAT'S THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING THE POWER OF OWN INITIATIVE TO AN OMBUDSMAN 
POD1000000014_S0000067	AH YES IT IS YOU CAN INVESTIGATE 
POD1000000014_S0000068	EVEN IF YOU GET COMPLAINTS SOMETIMES YOU'RE CONSTRAINED BECAUSE YOU CAN ONLY INVESTIGATE ON THE FACTS IF YOU CAN'T UNDERTAKE OWN-INITIATIVE INVESTIGATIONS 
POD1000000014_S0000069	IF SOMETHING COMES UP THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT THERE'S NO CONSTRAINTS ON ME LOOKING AT THAT 
POD1000000014_S0000070	AND PARTICULARLY I'VE FOUND THAT AH IN THE CONTEXT OF EXCLUDED GROUPS IT'S A VERY POWERFUL TOOL TO USE TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO DON'T COME TO YOU CAN NONETHELESS HAVE ACCESS TO JUSTICE 
POD1000000014_S0000071	YEAH AND IS THAT REGARDED AS CONTROVERSIAL IN IRELAND I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT SO 
POD1000000014_S0000072	NO NO IT'S JUST PART OF THE AH TOOLKIT AVAILABLE TO THE OFFICE I DON'T THINK ANYBODY GIVES IT ANY SECOND THOUGHT 
POD1000000014_S0000073	AND YOU YOU BEHAVED VERY BRAVELY IN IN THIS INVESTIGATION BECAUSE AT ONE POINT WHEN YOU WERE BEING BLOCKED BY MINISTERS YOU THREATENED TO GO TO THE 
POD1000000014_S0000075	IS THAT IS THAT RIGHT 
POD1000000014_S0000076	WHEN I WAS BEING BLOCKED BY OFFICIALS I WENT TO THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE AND THROUGH HIM TO THE 
POD1000000014_S0000078	THE PRIME MINISTER 
POD1000000014_S0000079	I ASKED THAT THEY PERSONALLY LOOK TO RESOLVE THE MATTER BECAUSE IT WAS SUCH A A STARK INJUSTICE SOME REFLECTED VERY POORLY ON THE GOVERNMENT OF IRELAND 
POD1000000014_S0000081	GONE THE MINISTER FOR JUSTICE BOTH ACTED WITH GREAT EXPEDIENCY AND THE MATTER WAS RESOLVED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THEIR INTERVENTION 
POD1000000014_S0000082	I DON'T THINK YOU CAN BE AN EFFECTIVE OMBUDSMAN WITHOUT HAVING THE KIND OF GUTS THAT YOU'VE SHOWN THROUGHOUT THIS 
POD1000000014_S0000083	AND THE I HOPE YOU WILL SYMPATHISE WITH THOSE OMBUDSMEN THAT DON'T HAVE OWN-INITIATIVE POWERS BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME TO BE A GREAT HAND 
POD1000000014_S0000084	I DON'T THINK IT IS I MEAN EVEN IN A WELSH CONTEXT WHERE I DIDN'T HAVE THEM AT THE TIME 
POD1000000014_S0000085	YOU COULD BE INVESTIGATING SOMETHING IN ONE HEALTH BOARD AND SEE IMMEDIATELY THAT IT WAS LIKELY THAT THE SAME PROBLEMS WERE ARISING ELSEWHERE 
POD1000000014_S0000086	BUT TECHNICALLY YOU COULDN'T EXTEND YOUR INVESTIGATION BEYOND THE BODY YOU WERE INVESTIGATING 
POD1000000014_S0000087	THAT ABILITY TO EXTEND AN INVESTIGATION TO COVER WHICHEVER BODIES ARE INVOLVED IS VERY POWERFUL 
POD1000000014_S0000088	SO A LOT OF MY WORK LET'S SAY WITH ASYLUM SEEKERS AND REFUGEES IN ACCOMMODATION PROVIDED ON BEHALF OF THE GOVERNMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000089	AND I WILL BE LOOKING AT COMPLAINTS THAT ARE TO DO WITH HEALTHCARE THAT ARE TO DO WITH ACCESS TO BENEFITS THAT ARE TO DO WITH ALL KINDS OF THINGS ACCESS TO HOUSING 
POD1000000014_S0000090	OTHER THAN THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN PROVIDING THE ACCOMMODATION 
POD1000000014_S0000091	SO IT IS JUST THAT CAPACITY TO BROADEN OUT AN INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS THE CAPACITY TO INSTIGATE AN INVESTIGATION WHERE YOU DON'T HAVE COMPLAINTS 
POD1000000014_S0000092	NOW MY CURRENT OWN-INITIATIVE INVESTIGATION IS LOOKING AT THE SITUATION OF PEOPLE UNDER SIXTY-FIVE LIVING IN NURSING HOMES 
POD1000000014_S0000093	THAT'S BECOME A MUCH MORE PRESSING ISSUE AND THE CORONAVIRUS CRISIS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WE'VE INTERVIEWED HAS ALREADY DIED ANOTHER HAS CONTRACTED THE VIRUS 
POD1000000014_S0000094	SO ALTHOUGH AT THIS POINT IT'S NOT POSSIBLE FOR OBVIOUS REASONS TO CONCLUDE THE INVESTIGATION 
POD1000000014_S0000095	WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WRITTEN TO THE LEADERS OF ALL THE POLITICAL PARTIES WHO ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED AND TALKS LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF A NEW GOVERNMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000096	TO HIGHLIGHT THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE SO THAT AT LEAST WHAT WE'VE LEARNT TO DATE IN THE COURSE OF OUR INVESTIGATION CAN HOPEFULLY HELP TO SHAPE THE POLICIES OF THE INCOMING GOVERNMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000097	CAN WE JUST MOVE ON A LITTLE BIT 
POD1000000014_S0000098	YOU YOU ARE THE PRESIDENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL OMBUDSMAN INSTITUTE WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND PRESTIGIOUS JOB WHICH IS VERY VALUABLE TO OMBUDSMEN ALL OVER THE WORLD 
POD1000000014_S0000099	WHAT ADDED VALUE DO YOU THINK THE I O I BRINGS TO TO OUR DISCUSSIONS 
POD1000000014_S0000100	WELL I THINK ONE THE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS IS STRAIGHTFORWARDLY LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER 
POD1000000014_S0000101	BEING AN OMBUDSMAN IS NECESSARILY AN ISOLATED ROLE WHAT YOU CAN'T DO IS BE TOO CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE SERVICES WHICH ARE WITHIN YOUR JURISDICTION 
POD1000000014_S0000102	SO CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON WITH EACH OTHER THAN WE DO WITH THE PEOPLE WHOSE SERVICES WE'RE LOOKING AT AND LEARNING FROM EACH OTHER IS VERY IMPORTANT 
POD1000000014_S0000103	THE I O I PROVIDES STRUCTURED TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES THAT'S BEEN ONE OF THE THE VERY VALUABLE THINGS WE'VE DONE 
POD1000000014_S0000104	IT PROVIDES BEST PRACTICE PAPERS TO SHOW HOW THINGS CAN BEST BE DONE 
POD1000000014_S0000105	AND OF COURSE ROB YOU YOURSELF HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BEST PRACTICE PAPER ON ON PEER REVIEW AND THE WORK YOU'VE DONE IN THAT FIELD 
POD1000000014_S0000106	AND BUT ALSO I THINK THE I O I HAS PLAYED A BIG PART IN SUPPORTING OMBUDSMAN ORGANISATIONS UNDER THREAT 
POD1000000014_S0000107	WE'VE SEEN FOR INSTANCE COLLEAGUES IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD WHO BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB ARE BEING THREATENED OR IGNORED BY THEIR GOVERNMENTS 
POD1000000014_S0000108	AND WE'VE SEEN THINGS LIKE BUDGETS BEING CUT AND WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE BEING DENOUNCED BY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND SO ON 
POD1000000014_S0000109	SO THE SOLIDARITY OF THE INTERNATIONAL OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY IS VERY IMPORTANT BUT WE ALSO INTERVENE QUITE DIRECTLY 
POD1000000014_S0000110	I GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF UM CYPRUS WHERE THE AUDITOR-GENERAL WAS LOOKING TO INTERFERE IN THE WORK OF THE OMBUDSMAN'S OFFICE 
POD1000000014_S0000111	FOLLOWING INTERVENTION FROM THE I O I AND OTHERS WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF CYPRUS AND THE PARLIAMENT IN PARTICULAR THE THREATS WERE WITHDRAWN 
POD1000000014_S0000112	AND IN POLAND THE OMBUDSMAN WAS THREATENED WITH LARGE CUTS TO HIS BUDGET WE SENT IN A COMMISSION OF INQUIRY 
POD1000000014_S0000113	WE INTERVIEWED GOVERNMENT MINISTERS WE INTERVIEWED THE JUDICIARY 
POD1000000014_S0000114	AND WE CARRIED OUT PRESS CONFERENCES WE TALKED TO N G OS AND WE MANAGED TO GET A STAY OF EXECUTION 
POD1000000014_S0000115	AND SO WE SAW MAJOR THREATS TO DEMOCRACY THERE BUT OUR INTERVENTION ALONG WITH THOSE OF OTHERS HAS HELPED TO ENSURE THAT THAT OFFICE IS STILL THERE AND IS CONTINUING TO OPERATE EFFECTIVELY 
POD1000000014_S0000116	THAT POLISH INTERVENTION WAS CRUCIAL 
POD1000000014_S0000117	AND WHAT'S ONE OF THE REMARKABLE THINGS ABOUT IT WAS YOU ACTUALLY WENT THERE DIDN'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT 
POD1000000014_S0000118	BUT YOU PUT THE POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER PRESSURE BY ASKING THEM TO GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT THEY WERE DOING 
POD1000000014_S0000119	ABSOLUTELY SO WE DID THAT IN PERSON AND WE DID IT THROUGH THE MEDIA SO THAT IT HAD A VERY HIGH PROFILE WITHIN POLAND I THINK IT'S AH IT'S NO GOOD 
POD1000000014_S0000120	I DID THE SAME IN CYPRUS MEDIA INTERVIEWS AND TALK TO PEOPLE ON THE GROUND 
POD1000000014_S0000121	I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT SOLIDARITY IS NOT SOMETHING THAT COMES JUST IN THE FORM OF THE LETTER THOUGH SOMETIMES A LETTER CAN BE EFFECTIVE ENOUGH IN ITSELF 
POD1000000014_S0000122	BUT THAT YOU ACTUALLY SCALE THE INTERVENTION TO THE NATURE OF THE CHALLENGE 
POD1000000014_S0000123	WE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS QUITE A LOT WHEN WE'VE NOT BEEN ON THE RADIO BUT 
POD1000000014_S0000124	HOW IMPORTANT DO YOU THINK IT IS THAT WE AS OMBUDS DO NOT GET INVOLVED IN POLITICAL MATTERS 
POD1000000014_S0000125	OR DO YOU THINK THIS IS A CULTURAL RELIC OF BRITISH IMPERIALISM 
POD1000000014_S0000127	WHATEVER ABOUT BRITISH IMPERIALISM NO I THINK IT'S A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION 
POD1000000014_S0000128	I THINK THAT FOR AN OMBUDSMAN NOT TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY DOING IS OVERSEEING THE SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE STATE 
POD1000000014_S0000129	AND SO THEREFORE ANY COMMENT WE MAKE ON THOSE SERVICES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE POLITICAL 
POD1000000014_S0000130	WHAT WE CAN'T BE IS PARTY POLITICAL AND WHAT WE CAN'T DO IS SPEAK BEYOND THE EVIDENCE OF OUR CASEBOOK 
POD1000000014_S0000131	SO I TALKED EARLIER ON ABOUT SEEKING TO UM EFFECT THE FORMATION OF THE GOVERNMENT IN IRELAND TO TO PROMOTE PARTICULAR POLICIES TO FAVOUR DISADVANTAGED GROUPS OF PEOPLE 
POD1000000014_S0000132	BUT I'M DOING THAT ON THE BASIS OF INVESTIGATIONS I'M CARRYING OUT 
POD1000000014_S0000133	I'M NOT DOING IT AS PETER TYNDALL CITIZEN I'M DOING IT AS OMBUDSMAN OF IRELAND BASED ON THE EVIDENCE FROM MY CASEBOOK 
POD1000000014_S0000134	AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO INTERVENE 
POD1000000014_S0000135	I THINK IT BECOMES PROBLEMATIC IF PEOPLE ARE SEEN TO BE INTERVENING ON ISSUES WHICH GO BEYOND THEIR OWN WORK AS OMBUDSMAN 
POD1000000014_S0000136	I THINK THAT'S WHERE IT WOULD BECOME PROBLEMATIC 
POD1000000014_S0000137	BUT I DO THINK THAT IF YOU'VE GOT EVIDENCE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU USE THAT EVIDENCE WHERE IT CAN BE MOST EFFECTIVE IN SECURING JUSTICE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO'VE COME TO YOU 
POD1000000014_S0000138	SO WE'RE MOVING TOWARDS THE END BUT I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT HOW YOU'RE COPING WITH THE CORONAVIRUS 
POD1000000014_S0000139	WHAT SORT OF IMPACT HAS IT HAD SHORT TERM AND LONGER TERM ON ON THE WAY YOU OPERATE 
POD1000000014_S0000140	YES IT'S AN INTERESTING ONE 
POD1000000014_S0000141	UM THE THE FIRST THING WAS THAT WE SURPRISED OURSELVES BY BEING ABLE TO GET OURSELVES IN A POSITION TO WORK REMOTELY MUCH QUICKER THAN WE MIGHT HAVE DONE OTHERWISE 
POD1000000014_S0000142	I SUPPOSE IF IT'S PROVED ANYTHING IT'S THAT WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS IT'S SURPRISING HOW LONG-TERM PROBLEMS CAN BE SOLVED IN A HURRY 
POD1000000014_S0000143	AND SO WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO OPERATE ALL OF OUR SERVICES MORE OR LESS WITHOUT CHANGE THROUGHOUT THE CRISIS 
POD1000000014_S0000144	WE'VE HAD SOME CHANGES IN VOLUMES OF WORK COMING TO US 
POD1000000014_S0000145	WE'VE PUT A BIT MORE EMPHASIS ON PROJECT WORK BUT BY AND LARGE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO MAKE THEIR COMPLAINTS TO US 
POD1000000014_S0000146	THEY CAN RING US THEY CAN EMAIL US 
POD1000000014_S0000147	THEY CAN AH CONTACT US ON THE WEB 
POD1000000014_S0000148	UM WE'RE EVEN ABLE TO COLLECT OUR POST THOUGH WE'RE DISCOURAGING PEOPLE FROM USING THE POST AT THE MOMENT BUT THE EFFECT OF THAT IS THAT WE CAN KEEP GOING 
POD1000000014_S0000149	THE DIFFICULTIES WE FACE ARE PROBABLY MORE TO DO WITH THE DIFFICULTIES BEING FACED BY THE SERVICES WE'RE DEALING WITH 
POD1000000014_S0000150	SO WE'VE TOLD THE HEALTH SERVICE WE'VE TOLD NURSING HOMES AND WE'VE TOLD THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL PROTECTION WHICH DEALS WITH BENEFITS AND PENSIONS 
POD1000000014_S0000151	THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT WILL TAKE THEM LONGER TO RESPOND TO US AND THAT IN SOME INSTANCES THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO 
POD1000000014_S0000152	SO SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT AND BUT IN GENERAL WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP GOING 
POD1000000014_S0000153	JUST GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF THINGS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH 
POD1000000014_S0000154	WE HAD ONE GENTLEMAN STUCK IN POLAND WHO COULDN'T GET BACK TO IRELAND WHO'D BEEN DENIED BENEFIT IN IRELAND EVEN THOUGH HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN WERE IN IRELAND AND HE NORMALLY LIVED AND WORKED 
POD1000000014_S0000155	AND WE WERE ABLE TO INTERVENE SUCCESSFULLY SO THAT HE GOT HIS BENEFITS SO WE'RE ABLE TO DEAL WITH ISSUES AS THEY ARISE 
POD1000000014_S0000156	I THINK IN THE LONGER TERM THERE'LL BE TWO THINGS REALLY ONE OF THEM IS JUST PRACTICAL 
POD1000000014_S0000157	WE NOW KNOW THAT IT'S POSSIBLE FOR MORE OF OUR PEOPLE TO WORK EFFECTIVELY FROM HOME AND I CAN'T SEE US GOING BACK TO THE SITUATION BEFORE WHERE ONLY A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE DID THAT 
POD1000000014_S0000158	I THINK MORE PEOPLE WILL WORK FROM HOME AS A CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT WE'VE LEARNT DURING THE CRISIS 
POD1000000014_S0000159	BUT THE SECOND ISSUE FOR ME HAS BEEN THE APPALLING DEATH TOLL AMONG PEOPLE IN INSTITUTIONAL CARE MANY OF WHOM SHOULDN'T BE THERE 
POD1000000014_S0000160	AND I THINK WE HAVE TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN WORKING ON THEIR BEHALF AFTER THE CRISIS TO MAKE SURE THAT SHOULD THERE BE A RESURGENCE OR SHOULD SOMETHING ELSE LIKE THIS COME ALONG 
POD1000000014_S0000161	THAT THEY'RE NOT AS EXPOSED AND AS VULNERABLE AS THEY ARE AT THE MOMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000162	IT IT MAKES COMPLETE SENSE FOR THE OMBUDSMAN TO BE LOOKING AT BOTH HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE MATTERS 
POD1000000014_S0000163	AND NOT AS IN THIS COUNTRY TO HAVE A SEPARATION WHERE ONE OMBUDSMAN LOOKS AT SOCIAL CARE AND THE OTHER LOOKS AT HEALTH 
POD1000000014_S0000164	I I'LL JUST IF I MAY ROB JUST ADD SOMETHING 
POD1000000014_S0000165	ONE THE THINGS THAT'S NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT BETWEEN IRELAND AND THE U K AND ENGLAND IN PARTICULAR IS THAT THERE IS A SINGLE NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN IN IRELAND 
POD1000000014_S0000166	SO THAT ISSUES OF HEALTH AND SOCIAL CARE CAN BOTH COME INTO MY JURISDICTION 
POD1000000014_S0000167	THE REALITY IS THESE THESE ARE COMPLEX INTERLINKED ISSUES 
POD1000000014_S0000168	I'M TRYING TO DEAL WITH THEM WITH TWO SEPARATE OMBUDSMAN OFFICES IT'S COMPLICATED ENOUGH AS IT IS 
POD1000000014_S0000169	TRYING TO DO SO IN THE CONTEXT WHERE YOU HAVE M P FILTERS 
POD1000000014_S0000170	WHERE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS APPLYING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE U K IS IMPOSSIBLY DIFFICULT FOR YOURSELVES 
POD1000000014_S0000171	BUT YOU MANAGE IT VERY WELL ALONG WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OMBUDSMAN 
POD1000000014_S0000172	AND I HAVE TO SAY YOU'VE MANAGED IN PRACTICE TO OVERCOME THE DIFFICULTIES BUT IT'S ALSO AN IMPOSSIBLY COMPLEX SCENARIO FOR COMPLAINANTS 
POD1000000014_S0000173	IN IRELAND SOMEBODY WANTS TO COMPLAIN ABOUT PUBLIC SERVICES THEY COME TO MY OFFICE 
POD1000000014_S0000174	IN YOUR CASE IT'S MUCH MORE COMPLICATED 
POD1000000014_S0000175	AND I DO HOPE THAT THE PROPOSALS FOR OMBUDSMAN REFORM THAT WE'VE SEEN IN IN THE U K OVER RECENT YEARS ARE NOT ENTIRELY LOST 
POD1000000014_S0000176	AND THAT WE DO COME TO A MUCH MORE SATISFACTORY SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A PROPER NATIONAL OMBUDSMAN AND WHERE PEOPLE CAN BRING THEIR COMPLAINTS REGARDLESS OF WHAT PARTICULAR PUBLIC SERVICE THEY'RE COMPLAINING ABOUT 
POD1000000014_S0000177	AND I DO HOPE THAT HAPPENS BEFORE I DIE WHICH I'M INCREASINGLY BECOMING DOUBTFUL ABOUT BUT WE'LL WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE 
POD1000000014_S0000178	PETER YOU CONDUCTED THE PEER REVIEW OF MY ORGANISATION AND THEN YOU APPEARED BEFORE THE SELECT COMMITTEE IN PARLIAMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000179	SO THAT WAS NOT AN EXPECTED DEVELOPMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000180	AH WHAT WHAT WAS IT LIKE BEING BEING THE PEER REVIEWER WHO HAD TO GO BEFORE THE U K PARLIAMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000181	IT WAS AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE ROBERT 
POD1000000014_S0000182	I THINK IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE CHALLENGING IF I HADN'T BEEN UM QUITE SO IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE SERVICE YOUR OFFICE PROVIDES 
POD1000000014_S0000183	IT WASN'T AS THOUGH WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE SERVICE WE USED A LOT OF OBJECTIVE CRITERIA 
POD1000000014_S0000184	AND OBVIOUSLY AH WITH ANY OFFICE THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT BUT IN GENERAL I WAS ABLE TO GIVE REASSURANCE TO THE COMMITTEE AS THE QUALITY OF SERVICE THAT COMPLAINANTS WERE RECEIVING 
POD1000000014_S0000185	BUT ALSO TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE DEFICIENCIES IN POWERS AND IN JURISDICTION THAT ARE CAUSING YOU DIFFICULTIES IN PRACTICE 
POD1000000014_S0000186	BUT THEN I SUPPOSE WHAT I'D WANT TO SAY I WAS VERY IMPRESSED BY THE QUALITY OF THE PEOPLE IN YOUR OFFICE 
POD1000000014_S0000187	AND IT WAS A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE THEY WERE VERY OPEN WITH US 
POD1000000014_S0000188	WE TALKED TO YOUR STAFF WITHOUT TALKING TO YOURSELF TO THE MANAGERS SO WE WERE ABLE FOR PEOPLE TO EXPRESS A VIEW AS THEY SO FIT AND I THINK PEOPLE WERE VERY COMPLEMENTARY 
POD1000000014_S0000189	SO I THINK AS I SAY IT WAS AN AN INTERESTING EXPERIENCE 
POD1000000014_S0000190	IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGING TO GO BEFORE PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEES AND THE SESSION WAS QUITE SEARCHING 
POD1000000014_S0000191	I THINK THE COMMITTEE WANTED TO REASSURE ITSELF THAT THIS WASN'T SOME KIND OF HAGIOGRAPHY 
POD1000000014_S0000192	BUT WE WERE SATISFIED IN THE END THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SAY NO WE'VE LOOKED IN DETAIL AT THIS OFFICE 
POD1000000014_S0000193	THERE ARE AREAS WHICH CAN IMPROVE BUT BY AND LARGE THIS IS AN IMPROVING SERVICE THAT'S DELIVERING GOOD-QUALITY OMBUDSMAN SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND AND TO THE U K 
POD1000000014_S0000194	WELL I THINK THE STRUCTURAL POINT IS THAT THANKS TO THE I O I THIS THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF PEER REVIEW LOOKS LIKE IT HAS LEGS FOR THE WIDER OMBUDSMAN COMMUNITY 
POD1000000014_S0000195	AND IT IS AN EFFECTIVE AND INEXPENSIVE WAY OF ADDING TO SCRUTINY OF OMBUDSMAN SCHEMES SO THANK YOU FOR THE ROLE THAT YOU PLAYED IN PIONEERING THAT 
POD1000000014_S0000196	ONE THING BEYOND THAT TOO ROB IS THAT AH 
POD1000000014_S0000197	SINCE THE REVIEW WAS UNDERTAKEN THE I O I ALONG WITH OTHER BODIES HAVE WORKED QUITE HARD 
POD1000000014_S0000198	WHAT THE VENICE COMMISSION AND THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE IN DEVELOPING A SET OF OVERRIDING PRINCIPLES FOR OMBUDSMAN OFFICES THE VENICE PRINCIPLES AS THEY'VE BECOME KNOWN 
POD1000000014_S0000199	AND THEY'VE NOW BEEN ADOPTED BY THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE 
POD1000000014_S0000200	AND THAT'S THE FIRST TIME THERE'S BEEN A PROPER INTERNATIONAL STANDARD AGAINST WHICH OMBUDS OFFICES CAN BE JUDGED 
POD1000000014_S0000201	AND SO I'M KEEN TO SEE THEM BEING USED AS THEY ARE BEING USED NOW IN THE CONTEXT OF PEER REVIEW 
POD1000000014_S0000202	SO THAT THERE IS AN OBJECTIVE SET OF INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNISED STANDARDS AGAINST WHICH YOU'RE MEASURING A PARTICULAR OMBUDSMAN OFFICE 
POD1000000014_S0000203	SO I THINK THAT'S AGAIN MARKS ANOTHER STEP FORWARD AND ONE THAT I'M VERY PLEASED TO HAVE SEEN DEVELOP 
POD1000000014_S0000204	I THINK WHEN I UNDERTOOK THE PEER REVIEW OF THE CATALONIAN OMBUDSMAN WITH MY BELGIAN COUNTERPART 
POD1000000014_S0000205	WE USED THOSE VERY SAME VENICE PRINCIPLES AS THE BENCHMARK AGAINST WHICH TO JUDGE THE CATALONIAN OMBUDSMAN 
POD1000000014_S0000206	AND IT IS VERY HELPFUL TO HAVE THAT BECAUSE IT'S WITHOUT PREJUDICE 
POD1000000014_S0000207	IT APPLIES TO EVERYONE SO I THINK IT IS AN IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT 
POD1000000014_S0000208	SO TWO FINAL QUESTIONS HOW HAVE YOU PETER TYNDALL REACTED TO WORKING REMOTELY BEING AT HOME WITH YOUR FAMILY 
POD1000000014_S0000209	I'VE ENJOYED IT TO BE HONEST 
POD1000000014_S0000210	IT HASN'T BEEN TOO FRUSTRATING THE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE AN ISSUE FROM TIME TO TIME BUT IT IT HASN'T BEEN TOO DIFFICULT 
POD1000000014_S0000211	IT IT'S BEEN LESS DIFFICULT THAN I WOULD HAVE EXPECTED 
POD1000000014_S0000212	DOES TIME GOES ON I THINK THE ISSUE OF VISIBLE LEADERSHIP COMES INTO IT DOESN'T IT 
POD1000000014_S0000213	SO YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO TO BE WITH YOUR PEOPLE AGAIN BUT BUT IT WORKS SURPRISINGLY WELL 
POD1000000014_S0000214	AND 
POD1000000014_S0000215	AS I SAY I THINK FOR THE OFFICE ITSELF I THINK WE'LL SEE MORE REMOTE WORKING IN THE FUTURE 
POD1000000014_S0000216	THANK YOU SO LASTLY THEN IT'S WHAT I ALWAYS ASK MY GUESTS 
POD1000000014_S0000217	WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUNG COLLEAGUES NEWLY ARRIVING AS CASEWORKERS IN THE EMBRYONIC OMBUDSMAN PROFESSION 
POD1000000014_S0000218	FOR ME THERE IS UM THERE IS A COUPLE OF CHARACTERISTICS THAT HAVE TO BE EMBODIED BY PEOPLE WORKING IN THE SERVICE OR AS AN OMBUDSMAN 
POD1000000014_S0000219	WE HAVE TO BE OBJECTIVE WE HAVE TO BE FAIR 
POD1000000014_S0000220	WE HAVE TO BE EVEN-HANDED SO THE FIRST ADVICE OFTEN IS MAKE SURE YOU KNOW THE WHOLE STORY BEFORE YOU REACH YOUR CONCLUSION 
POD1000000014_S0000221	BUT UNDERPINNING ALL OF THAT I WOULD SAY THAT IF YOU HAVEN'T GOT A PASSIONATE COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE THEN YOU'RE IN THE WRONG JOB 
POD1000000014_S0000222	BECAUSE WHAT THIS FUNDAMENTALLY IS ABOUT IS PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN FAIRNESS PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE IN JUSTICE AND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO USE THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY IS DENIED ACCESS TO JUSTICE 
POD1000000014_S0000223	AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR 
POD1000000014_S0000224	THANK YOU SO MUCH PETER 
POD1000000014_S0000225	YOUR ANSWERS WERE STIMULATING AND ALSO INSPIRATIONAL 
POD1000000014_S0000227	WE'RE ALL VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME YOU'VE GIVEN FOR THIS INTERVIEW 
POD1000000014_S0000228	THANKS A LOT

POD1000000017_S0000001	FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES MAGAZINE I'M NIKOLE HANNAH-JONES THIS IS SIXTEEN NINETEEN 
POD1000000017_S0000003	THIS WEEK WESLEY MORRIS ON THE BIRTH OF AMERICAN MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000005	SO LAST FALL I AM AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE WE ARE MAKING DINNER I'M CHOPPING VEGETABLES AND I ASKED MY FRIEND BRETT WHO WAS COOKING WITH ME CAN YOU PUT ON SOME MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000006	AND HE SAID WHAT DO YOU WANNA LISTEN TO AND I SAID HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF YACHT ROCK AND HE SAID WHAT I SAID YACHT ROCK HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THIS AND HE GOES NO I HAVE NOT 
POD1000000017_S0000007	SO HE FINDS THE YACHT ROCK STATION IN PANDORA WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHY OR HOW HE'S STILL A PANDORA GUY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO PANDORA HE IS ONE AND HE FINDS THE YACHT ROCK STATION 
POD1000000017_S0000009	AT SOME POINT BRETT HAS TO GO RUN AN ERRAND I THINK I MIGHT HAVE SENT HIM ON ONE I DON'T REMEMBER BUT HE'S GONE SO I'M ALONE JUST ME WITH THE VEGETABLES AND THE YACHT ROCK 
POD1000000017_S0000011	IT GIVES ME PLENTY OF TIME TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THE SONGS I'M HEARING 
POD1000000017_S0000013	WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MUSIC MADE BETWEEN THE YEARS OF I DON'T KNOW I WOULD SAY LIKE NINETEEN SEVENTY-FIVE TO ABOUT NINETEEN EIGHTY-THREE THINGS LIKE 
POD1000000017_S0000015	ACES HOW LONG 
POD1000000017_S0000017	SEALS AND CROFTS TO DOING SUMMER BREEZE I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE 
POD1000000017_S0000019	STEAL AWAY BY ROBBIE DUPREE 
POD1000000017_S0000021	AND THE DOOBIE BROTHERS WHAT A FOOL BELIEVES 
POD1000000017_S0000023	IT IS LIKE OUR SOFT ROCK-EST PERIOD IN AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000025	THE JOKE OF YACHT ROCK IS THAT WHOEVER INVENTED IT WHOEVER'S MAKING A PLAYLIST OUT OF THESE SONGS IS BASICALLY SAYING THAT THEY'RE INCONSEQUENTIAL AND THAT WHAT'S IN THEM DOESN'T MATTER 
POD1000000017_S0000027	BUT WHAT I KNOW I'M HEARING IS SOMETHING BIGGER AND DEEPER THAN THAT 
POD1000000017_S0000029	EVERY SONG HAS SOMETHING ABOUT IT THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE OTHER SONGS 
POD1000000017_S0000031	I'M HEARING THINGS LIKE ROSANNA BY TOTO 
POD1000000017_S0000033	WHICH SEEMS PERFECTLY BANAL HAS A REALLY GOOD BEAT SORT OF BUILDS TO ITS CHORUS 
POD1000000017_S0000035	BUT THEN AT THE END 
POD1000000017_S0000037	I'M HEARING 
POD1000000017_S0000039	THE GREAT DOO-WOP HARMONIES OF THE FIFTIES AND SIXTIES 
POD1000000017_S0000041	THERE IS SOMETHING JAZZ LIKE IN THE SYNCOPATED MUSIC OF SOMETHING LIKE STEELY DAN 
POD1000000017_S0000043	YOU CAN HEAR IN SOMEBODY LIKE MICHAEL MCDONALD 
POD1000000017_S0000045	THAT IS LIKE A GOSPEL BREAKDOWN 
POD1000000017_S0000047	WHAT I'M HEARING IN ALL OF THESE SONGS IS BASICALLY BLACKNESS 
POD1000000017_S0000049	AND THE SONG IN WHICH I AM HEARING IT THE DEEPEST AND STRONGEST AND MOST POWERFULLY AT LEAST TO ME STANDING IN THAT KITCHEN CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES WAS WHEN KENNY LOGGINS'S THIS IS IT COMES ON 
POD1000000017_S0000051	IT'S GOT A KIND OF LOOSELY DISCO LIKE RHYTHM TO IT THERE'S A LOT OF PERCUSSION SORT OF GOING BACK AND FORTH AND AROUND 
POD1000000017_S0000053	SURE KENNY LOGGINS IS BASICALLY SING-WHISPERING THE VERSES IN THIS SONG 
POD1000000017_S0000055	DOING THIS VERY LIGHT 
POD1000000017_S0000056	COOL 
POD1000000017_S0000058	AND THEN IN THE PRE-CHORUS KENNY LOGGINS DISAPPEARS AND WHO SHOWS UP MICHAEL MCDONALD 
POD1000000017_S0000060	GIVING KENNY LOGGINS PLENTY OF TIME TO GATHER HIMSELF 
POD1000000017_S0000062	WHEN HE SINGS THE WORD MIRACLE HE DOESN'T SING MIRACLE HE GOES MIRACLE 
POD1000000017_S0000064	LIKE HE IS SCRAPING THE BOTTOM OF A PAN TO GET ALL OF THE GOOD BITS OFF OF IT BEFORE YOU POUR THE GRAVY IN 
POD1000000017_S0000066	SCRAPING THE PAN IS THE BLACKEST THING YOU CAN DO AS A SINGER AND HERE IS KENNY LOGGINS AS THIS WHITE ARTIST DOING IT 
POD1000000017_S0000068	AND THEN THE GRAVY COMES 
POD1000000017_S0000070	HE IS LIKE AT THE TOP OF THE CHURCH AT THIS POINT 
POD1000000017_S0000071	HE HAS ELEVATED HIMSELF TO THE RAFTERS THERE'S LIKE NO MORE HE IS LIKE AT THE ROOF TRYING TO CLEAR A WAY TO GET TO HEAVEN BUT THERE'S JUST CHURCH ROOF IN THE WAY 
POD1000000017_S0000073	HE'S NOT THE GREATEST SINGER BUT THERE'S A KIND OF GUMPTION AND NERVE TO THE SINGING OF THIS SONG 
POD1000000017_S0000075	THAT CANNOT BE DENIED A TIP OF THE HAT TO HIM 
POD1000000017_S0000076	I JUST HAD TO STAND THERE AND I JUST I I I ACTUALLY CRACKED UP I I JUST PUT DOWN THE KNIFE AND I CRACKED UP AND IT FELT SO PLEASURABLE AND THEN I STARTED THINKING ABOUT ALL THESE OTHER SINGERS I LOVE 
POD1000000017_S0000078	I'M THINKING ABOUT AMY WINEHOUSE 
POD1000000017_S0000080	I'M THINKING ABOUT ANNIE LENNOX 
POD1000000017_S0000082	I'M THINKING ABOUT GEORGE MICHAEL 
POD1000000017_S0000084	I THINK ABOUT CHRIS STAPLETON 
POD1000000017_S0000085	YOU PRACTICES THIS KIND OF MUSCLY BLUES THAT GETS WRITTEN OFF AS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE'S A BIG WHITE GUY IN A HAT 
POD1000000017_S0000087	AND ONE OF THE MANY PHASES IN WHICH DAVID BOWIE REALLY WANTED TO MAKE R AND B AND SOUL MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000089	THIS IS THE SOUND NOT JUST OF BLACK AMERICA BUT THE SOUND OF AMERICA IT IS DEEPLY AMERICAN ALMOST ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S SUNG BY BRITISH PEOPLE LIKE DAVID BOWIE AND ANNIE LENNOX AND AMY WINEHOUSE 
POD1000000017_S0000090	AND IT FILLS ME WITH PRIDE LIKE I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IRRESISTIBLE AND ULTIMATELY INEVITABLE ABOUT BLACK MUSIC BEING A PART OF AMERICAN POPULAR MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000091	BUT IT ALSO REMINDS ME THAT THERE'S A HISTORY TO THIS A VERY PAINFUL HISTORY AND IN THE MOST PERVERSELY IRONIC WAY IT'S THIS HISTORICAL PAIN THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000093	SOME OF THE OLDEST RECORDINGS WE HAVE OF BLACK AMERICAN MUSIC ARE FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES 
POD1000000017_S0000094	AND THEY'RE SONGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUNG BY AMERICANS BORN INTO SLAVERY THERE'S THIS ONE CALLED OLD SHIP OF ZION 
POD1000000017_S0000095	YOU CAN HEAR IN IT THESE FOUR MEN THEIR VOICES ARE MOVING IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER 
POD1000000017_S0000097	AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL AND IT'S ALSO SAD YOU CAN FEEL THAT IN YOUR BONES 
POD1000000017_S0000098	AND THEN THERE'LL BE MUSIC THAT WAS COMPLETELY THE OPPOSITE LIKE OLD COON DOG FOR INSTANCE 
POD1000000017_S0000100	YOU CAN HEAR THE PLAYFULNESS IN THE SONG 
POD1000000017_S0000102	AND YOU'VE GOT THIS BANJO THIS GREAT AFRICAN INSTRUMENT THAT BECOMES THE BEDROCK OF AMERICAN MUSIC IN SO MANY WAYS AND THAT THING IS DANCING 
POD1000000017_S0000103	AND THEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE LIKE BILLY MCCREA 
POD1000000017_S0000104	AND OH MY GOD YOU CAN HEAR IN HIS SINGING WHAT WE WOULD NOW CALL SOMETHING LIKE THE LIVELONG DAY 
POD1000000017_S0000106	YEARS AND YEARS OF HARD WORK 
POD1000000017_S0000107	AND UNIMAGINABLE SORROW 
POD1000000017_S0000109	YOU CAN ALSO HEAR IN ALL OF THIS MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000111	THIS UNDENIABLE SOUND OF HOPE 
POD1000000017_S0000113	ALL OF THESE MELODIES AND CADENCES AND EMOTIONS ARE THINGS THAT WOULDN'T BE PASSED DOWN GENERATION AFTER GENERATION IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD ON A PLANTATION IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD WALKING BY A PLANTATION 
POD1000000017_S0000114	IT'S WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE HEARD PASSING A BLACK PERSON DOING HIS JOB ENTERTAINING HIMSELF DOING THE DRUDGERY OF WORK THE WAY A GUY NAMED THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE DID SOMETIME AROUND THE EIGHTEEN THIRTIES 
POD1000000017_S0000115	AS THE STORY GOES T D RICE A WHITE MAN THIS ANONYMOUS NOBODY ACTOR TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET 
POD1000000017_S0000116	ONE DAY HE'S TOURING WITH A TROUPE IN CINCINNATI OR MAYBE IT WAS PITTSBURGH WE DON'T REALLY KNOW BUT THE MYTH BASICALLY GOES T D RICE HAPPENED UPON AN OLD BLACK MAN CLEANING A HORSE IN A STABLE 
POD1000000017_S0000117	THE MAN WAS DOING HIS JOB ON PROPERTY OWNED BY A WHITE MAN NAMED CROW 
POD1000000017_S0000119	HE HEARD THE TUNE THIS OLD BLACK MAN WAS SINGING HE SAW THE WAY THIS MAN MOVED HIS BODY AS HE WAS CLEANING THIS HORSE 
POD1000000017_S0000120	NOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TUNE THIS OLD MAN WOULD'VE BEEN SINGING 
POD1000000017_S0000122	WHATEVER RICE HEARS COMING OUT OF THIS MAN'S MOUTH IS CAPTIVATING TO HIM AND WHAT HE SEES IS AN OPPORTUNITY 
POD1000000017_S0000124	BECAUSE SHOWBIZ IN THE EIGHTEEN THIRTIES LOOKED LIKE THIS 
POD1000000017_S0000126	ITALIAN OPERAS 
POD1000000017_S0000128	BRITISH PLAYS ENTERTAINMENT IMPORTED FROM EUROPE ALL THE PEOPLE PERFORMING THIS STUFF WOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE THE AUDIENCES WOULD HAVE BEEN WHITE 
POD1000000017_S0000129	AFTER ALL IT'S EIGHTEEN THIRTY SLAVERY IS IN FULL EFFECT 
POD1000000017_S0000131	AND WHEN IT CAME TO ENTERTAINMENT THERE WAS NOTHING NEW NOTHING TRULY AMERICAN 
POD1000000017_S0000133	AND SO WHEN T D RICE HEARS THIS BLACK MAN SINGING THIS SONG AND MOVING HIS BODY IN THIS PARTICULAR WAY DING A LIGHT BULB GOES OFF 
POD1000000017_S0000134	AND HE TAKES THAT LIGHT BULB AND RUNS ALL THE WAY TO THE THEATER HE FIGURES OUT A WAY TO MELT DOWN SOME CORK 
POD1000000017_S0000135	LET'S IT COOL PRESUMABLY TAKES A RAG OR MAYBE EVEN HIS HAND IF IT'S COOL ENOUGH 
POD1000000017_S0000137	AND THEN HE PAINTS HIS FACE BLACK 
POD1000000017_S0000139	HE GOES OUT ON STAGE BUT INSTEAD OF DOING HIS REGULAR ACT HE'S GOT THIS HORSE GROOMER'S TUNE EXCEPT NOW HE'S GIVEN THE TUNE LYRICS 
POD1000000017_S0000140	COME LISTEN ALL YOU GALS AND BOYS I'M JUST FROM TUCKAHOE I'M GOING TO SING A LITTLE SONG MY NAME'S JIM CROW 
POD1000000017_S0000142	AND THE LYRICS GIVE THE HORSE GROOMER A NAME AND THE NAME IS JIM CROW 
POD1000000017_S0000144	SO THE CROWD GOES CRAZY THEY GO SO BANANAS THE MAN GETS TWENTY ENCORES 
POD1000000017_S0000146	THIS IS THE FIRST TIME A PAYING AUDIENCE IS BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED BY A WHITE MAN WITH A BLACK FACE THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT JIM CROW WAS ALLEGEDLY INTRODUCED TO AMERICA THIS MASCOT OF AMERICAN RACISM 
POD1000000017_S0000147	AND THIS IS WHAT AMERICA REALLY WANTED WHICH WAS ITS OWN ORIGINAL ART FORM THAT IS NOT AN ITALIAN OPERA AND ISN'T SOME BRITISH GUY COMING OVER AND THESPIANING ALL OVER THEM 
POD1000000017_S0000148	AND HERE IS THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE GIVING IT TO THEM THIS IS THE NIGHT THAT AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE WAS BORN 
POD1000000017_S0000150	OH BOY I MEAN YOU KNOW HOW IT GOES THIS SENSATIONAL THING HAPPENS AND THEN EVERYBODY WANTS TO GET ON THE BANDWAGON AND DO THEIR OWN 
POD1000000017_S0000151	SO YOU HAVE OTHER MINSTREL ACTS WHO COME ALONG AND TRY TO DO WHAT THOMAS DARTMOUTH RICE IS DOING A SONG AND A DANCE 
POD1000000017_S0000152	AND A BLACK FACE ON THEIR WHITE SKIN 
POD1000000017_S0000154	AND THEN FROM THESE SOLO ACTS YOU HAVE BASICALLY BANDS FORMING 
POD1000000017_S0000156	AND THE BANDS HAVE ALL THE INSTRUMENTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IN A BAND THAT YOU'D RECOGNIZE NOW THERE IS A BANJO AND A FIDDLE AND SOME TAMBOURINES AND PERCUSSION IN THE FORM OF BONES WHICH WOULD COME FROM A PIG SOMETIMES 
POD1000000017_S0000157	THAT IS THE FORMATION OF WHAT WILL BECOME THE MINSTREL TROUPE 
POD1000000017_S0000159	AND THE PLACE THAT MINSTRELSY TOOK HOLD WAS IN THE NORTH 
POD1000000017_S0000160	PLACES LIKE PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK AND BOSTON WHERE YOU'D HAVE THESE THEATERS DEDICATED TO MINSTREL ACTS WHERE MINSTREL ACTS WOULD JUST MOVE INTO A THEATER AND DO THEIR ACT NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT AFTER NIGHT 
POD1000000017_S0000161	AND A LOT OF THESE PERFORMERS HAD NEVER BEEN MEANINGFULLY SOUTH TO HAVE A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP WITH BLACK PEOPLE AND SO THEY JUST MADE STUFF UP BASED ON WHAT THEY THOUGHT BLACK PEOPLE WERE LIKE 
POD1000000017_S0000163	THEY WERE ABLE TO DRAW ON THINGS THAT WERE COMING TO AMERICA FROM OTHER PARTS OF EUROPE LIKE THE POLKA 
POD1000000017_S0000165	AND SO YOU WOULD HAD OVER THE COURSE OF THE FORMATION OF THIS CULTURE AN INHERENT MIXING YOU HAD SOME AMAZING MIX OF AN IMAGINED BLACKNESS 
POD1000000017_S0000166	REAL ACTUAL IRISH MELODIES AND POLISH MUSIC WITH WHAT WE WOULD NOW CALL GOSPEL BUT SPIRITUAL HARMONIES INTERLACED TOGETHER WITH THIS AFRICAN BANJO 
POD1000000017_S0000168	BASICALLY WELDING INTO A FUSION THAT BECOMES THE THING THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO TRY TO DO 
POD1000000017_S0000170	THE WHOLE THING JUST SWEEPS THE NATION AND FOR THE REST OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THIS IS THE SHIT CAN WE SAY THAT 
POD1000000017_S0000172	AND SO FOR THE REST OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THIS IS THE SHIT 
POD1000000017_S0000174	THIS IS AMERICA'S PRIMARY FORM OF ENTERTAINMENT PEOPLE ARE GOING CRAZY FOR BLACKFACE MINSTRELS YOU HAVE LITTLE BOYS GOING TO BED AND DREAMING ABOUT HOW THEY CAN BECOME PART OF THIS MINSTREL SHOW 
POD1000000017_S0000175	SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE HAVING THESE DREAMS GO ON TO BECOME PEOPLE LIKE STEPHEN FOSTER 
POD1000000017_S0000177	STEPHEN FOSTER THE MAN WIDELY CREDITED AS BEING THE FATHER OF AMERICAN MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000179	SOME OF HIS SONGS SOME OF HIS MOST FAMOUS SONGS SONGS YOU KNOW SONGS YOU LOVE SONGS YOU STILL SING SONGS YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU HAVE THEM THEY STILL SING SOME OF THOSE SONGS WERE WRITTEN FOR BLACKFACE PERFORMERS 
POD1000000017_S0000181	AND IF YOU LISTEN TO SOMETHING LIKE CAMPTOWN RACES YOU CAN HEAR IN IT ALL OF ITS MINSTREL PROPERTIES 
POD1000000017_S0000183	THE SONG OF COURSE IS WRITTEN IN SO-CALLED NEGRO DIALECT I MEAN INSTEAD OF SAYING GOING YOU'RE SAYING GWINE 
POD1000000017_S0000185	LIKE INSTEAD OF SAYING O F FOR OF YOU GET A LOT OF D E FOR DE THIS IS A WHITE PERSON IMAGINING HOW A BLACK PERSON WOULD SING THIS SONG 
POD1000000017_S0000187	THIS IS A WHITE PERSON IMAGINING HOW A BLACK PERSON WOULD SING THIS SONG 
POD1000000017_S0000188	AND THAT WAS A GOLD RUSH ERA HIT 
POD1000000017_S0000190	THIS IS THE I WANNA HOLD YOUR HAND OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY-ONE 
POD1000000017_S0000192	PART OF THE PROBLEM THAT WE STILL LIVE WITH NOW IS THAT IT WAS SO MUCH THE HEART AND SOUL OF AMERICAN CULTURE THAT IT WASN'T THAT IT BECAME NOT RACIST 
POD1000000017_S0000193	IT JUST WAS A THING THAT YOU DID IF YOU WANTED TO BE AN ENTERTAINER AT ANY POINT AFTER EIGHTEEN THIRTY YOU IN ALL LIKELIHOOD WERE AT LEAST GONNA TRY TO BE A BLACKFACE MINSTREL EVEN IF YOU WERE BLACK 
POD1000000017_S0000195	AFTER THE CIVIL WAR ENDS AND THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BLACK PEOPLE TO PERFORM THEY HAVE TO DO WHAT THE NATION WANTS AND WHAT THE NATION WANTS AT THAT POINT IS BLACKFACE

POD1000000017_S0000200	BY THE TIME YOU HAVE BLACK PEOPLE PAINTING THEIR FACES BLACK TO PERFORM AS BLACK PEOPLE THE ONLY QUESTION YOU CAN REALLY ASK AT THIS POINT IS WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON WHY IS THIS HAPPENING 
POD1000000017_S0000201	WHAT WAS SO CAPTIVATING ABOUT SEEING BLACK PEOPLE REPRESENTED THIS WAY WHY WOULD A WHITE AUDIENCE HAVE CLAMORED FOR IT SO MUCH I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT IT OFFERED WAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT A THING THAT ACTUALLY FELT REALLY BAD AT THE TIME 
POD1000000017_S0000202	PEOPLE WERE REALLY TORN ABOUT WHETHER TO CONTINUE WITH SLAVERY OR WHETHER TO ABOLISH IT THE MINSTREL SHOW DIDN'T REALLY GIVE YOU AN ANSWER 
POD1000000017_S0000203	BUT IT PROVIDED A PLATFORM BY WHICH YOU COULD EITHER ESCAPE FROM ACTUALLY HAVING TO THINK ABOUT THAT QUESTION THAT REALLY WAS TEARING THE NATION APART OR DEPENDING ON WHICH SHOW YOU WOULD WIND UP SEEING 
POD1000000017_S0000204	IT FULLY ENGAGED YOU IN THE LIGHTEST POSSIBLE WAY ABOUT ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND HOW YOU DIDN'T REALLY HAVE TO FEEL SO BAD FOR THEM BECAUSE THEY LIKE BEING ENSLAVED YOU GOT TO LAUGH AT A THING THAT YOU ACTUALLY FELT SO ANGUISHED ABOUT 
POD1000000017_S0000205	YOU GET TO WATCH THESE BLACK PEOPLE WHO ARE REALLY A SOURCE OF NATIONAL AGONY OUTSIDE THE THEATER BECOME FOOLS INSIDE THE THEATER AND IN SITTING IN THAT THEATER WATCHING THESE WHITE MEN IN BLACKFACE MAKE FOOLS OF BLACK PEOPLE 
POD1000000017_S0000206	A WHITE AUDIENCE COULD FEEL CULTURED THEY COULD FEEL CIVILIZED THEY COULD FEEL SUPERIOR TO THE PEOPLE THEY WERE WATCHING BE MADE FUN OF 
POD1000000017_S0000207	AND IN A CRAZY WAY WATCHING THEM DEHUMANIZE WOULD REALLY HAVE BEEN AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A WHITE AUDIENCE TO FEEL SO MUCH BETTER ABOUT THEIR OWN HUMANITY 
POD1000000017_S0000209	BY THE TIME YOU GET TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY MINSTRELSY IS STILL WITH US IT IS THE BASIS UPON WHICH AMERICAN MOVIES ARE BUILT THIS COUNTRY'S FIRST MOVIE BLOCKBUSTER

POD1000000017_S0000226	BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S THE BEGINNINGS OF A RECORDING INDUSTRY AND YOU HAD BLACK ARTISTS WHO HAD ACCESS TO RECORDING STUDIOS 
POD1000000017_S0000227	OUT OF THESE RECORDINGS YOU HAVE PEOPLE LIKE MUDDY WATERS 
POD1000000017_S0000229	INVENTING AND PERFECTING BLUES RHYTHM BLUES IDEAS BLUES EXPRESSION THE EXPRESSION OF 
POD1000000017_S0000231	OF A FULLY HUMAN BLACK SELF IN AMERICAN POPULAR ART 
POD1000000017_S0000233	HE HAD A KIND OF CONFIDENCE THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NEVER HAVE HEARD COMING FROM A BLACK PERSON BEFORE 
POD1000000017_S0000235	AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING 
POD1000000017_S0000237	YOU HAVE THE ADVENT OF A PLACE LIKE BLUE NOTE RECORDS WHERE LOTS OF AMAZING JAZZ WAS CREATED AND THEN RELEASED INTO THE WORLD PEOPLE LIKE SIDNEY BECHET 
POD1000000017_S0000239	AND THEN LOUIS ARMSTRONG 
POD1000000017_S0000241	AND DUKE ELLINGTON 
POD1000000017_S0000243	YOU HAVE BLACK MUSICIANS THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MOVE NOT ONLY MUSIC FORWARD BUT AMERICAN CULTURE FORWARD 
POD1000000017_S0000245	THINKING ABOUT HOW THESE INSTRUMENTS CAN DO OTHER THINGS BESIDES MAKE WHAT WE THINK OF AS WESTERN EUROPEAN CLASSICAL MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000247	AND TAKING MUSIC TO A PLACE THAT NOBODY HAD EVER TRIED TO PREVIOUSLY TAKE IT 
POD1000000017_S0000249	PEOPLE WHO JUST KEPT PUSHING IT FORWARD AND BEYOND

POD1000000017_S0000253	AND THAT IS THE ADVENT OF MOTOWN RECORDS 
POD1000000017_S0000255	MOTOWN IS THE MOST POWERFUL MASS-PRODUCED EXPRESSION OF BLACK GLAMOUR OF BLACK SELF-CONFIDENCE OF BLACK SELF-RELIANCE 
POD1000000017_S0000257	ITS PROJECT WAS TO GET BLACK PRODUCERS BLACK MUSICIANS BLACK SINGERS TO TAKE QUOTE WHITE QUOTE WESTERN MUSICAL IDEAS OF ORCHESTRATION STRINGS AND HORNS 
POD1000000017_S0000259	AND STRAIGHTFORWARD HARMONIES 
POD1000000017_S0000261	AND YOU MARRY THEM TO A BLACK WEEKEND 
POD1000000017_S0000263	WHERE ON SATURDAY NIGHT YOU'RE AT A JUKE JOINT HAVING A GOOD TIME WITH RHYTHM AND BLUES MUSIC GUITAR AND DRUM AND BASS 
POD1000000017_S0000265	SEX BASICALLY 
POD1000000017_S0000267	AND THEN YOU GO HOME SLIGHTLY HUNG OVER 
POD1000000017_S0000269	AND YOU WAKE UP AND YOU GO TO CHURCH ON SUNDAY MORNING 
POD1000000017_S0000271	WHERE THERE'S A WHOLE OTHER MUSICAL EXPERIENCE INVOLVING HAND CLAPS AND DIFFERENT HARMONIC ARRANGEMENTS AND CALL AND RESPONSE 
POD1000000017_S0000273	A LOT OF FEELING A LOT OF OOMPH A LOT OF GRATITUDE 
POD1000000017_S0000275	YOU HAVE THE COMBINATION OF THESE THREE DIFFERENT AREAS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME IN JUST ABOUT EVERY SINGLE MOTOWN RECORD 
POD1000000017_S0000277	OR WHETHER IT'S THE FOUR TOPS DOING REACH OUT I'LL BE THERE 
POD1000000017_S0000279	OR MARTHA AND THE VANDELLAS DOING HEAT WAVE 
POD1000000017_S0000281	ON SOMETHING LIKE HEAT WAVE YOU CAN HEAR HANDS SLAPPING THE TAMBOURINE LIKE IT ACTUALLY IS SUNDAY MORNING 
POD1000000017_S0000283	THEN WHEN EVERYTHING IS FIRING 
POD1000000017_S0000285	IT'S JUST THE MOST EXCITING ROMANTIC SOUND YOU'RE YOU'RE EVER GONNA HEAR AND AT THE CENTER OF IT IS WHAT CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS A REFULGENT TASTEFUL BLACKNESS 
POD1000000017_S0000287	HERE YOU HAVE IN MOTOWN A FORCE THAT IS ACTIVELY COMBATING THESE IDEAS OF BLACK PEOPLE AS BEING INHERENTLY INFERIOR 
POD1000000017_S0000289	MOTOWN IS THE ANTIDOTE TO AMERICAN MINSTRELSY 
POD1000000017_S0000291	AND THIS IS WHAT I WAS THINKING ABOUT STANDING THERE IN THAT KITCHEN CHOPPING THOSE VEGETABLES IT'S THE THING THAT MADE ME LAUGH WAS JUST HOW ALL THAT HISTORY 
POD1000000017_S0000292	IS JUST VERY SILENTLY COURSING THROUGH THIS MUSIC IT MIGHT NOT EVEN BE AWARE THAT IT'S EVEN THERE IT'S SO THOROUGHLY ATOMIZED INTO AMERICAN CULTURE IT'S GONNA SHOW UP IN A WAY THAT EVEN PEOPLE MAKING THE ART CAN'T QUITE PUT THEIR FINGER ON 
POD1000000017_S0000294	WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IN BLACK MUSIC THAT'S SO APPEALING TO SO MANY PEOPLE OF ALL RACES ACROSS TIME IS POSSIBILITY STRUGGLE IT IS STRIFE IT IS HUMOR 
POD1000000017_S0000295	IT IS SEX IT IS CONFIDENCE AND THAT'S IRONIC BECAUSE THIS IS THE SOUND OF A PEOPLE WHO FOR DECADES AND CENTURIES HAVE BEEN DENIED FREEDOM 
POD1000000017_S0000296	AND YET WHAT YOU RESPOND TO IN BLACK MUSIC IS THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF A BELIEF IN THAT FREEDOM THE BELIEF THAT THE STRUGGLE IS WORTH IT THAT THE PAIN BEGETS JOY 
POD1000000017_S0000297	AND THAT THAT JOY YOU'RE EXPERIENCING IS NOT ONLY CONTAGIOUS IT'S NECESSARY AND URGENT AND IRRESISTIBLE BLACK MUSIC IS AMERICAN MUSIC 
POD1000000017_S0000298	BECAUSE AS AMERICANS WE SAY WE BELIEVE IN FREEDOM AND THAT'S WHAT WE TELL THE WORLD AND THE POWER OF BLACK MUSIC IS THAT IT'S THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF THAT BELIEF IN THE AMERICAN FREEDOM

POD1000000018_S0000001	YOU'VE ALL SEEN THIS TYPE OF NEWS COVERAGE BEFORE AN OVERVIEW OF THE CAREER IMAGES OF THE STAR IN THEIR PRIME PHONE IN CONVERSATIONS WITH OTHER CELEBRITIES WHO WERE CLOSE WITH THE DEPARTED 
POD1000000018_S0000003	LARRY KING IS ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO CALLED IN TO TALK THAT DAY HE'D HAD ANDY ON HIS VARIOUS SHOWS NUMEROUS TIMES AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING IN PASSING THAT'S REALLY INTERESTING 
POD1000000018_S0000005	WHAT LARRY SAID IS THAT A LAWYER NAMED PERCY FOREMAN WAS THE MAN WHO INSPIRED THE CHARACTER MATLOCK 
POD1000000018_S0000007	THIS WAS A WEIRD THING FOR ANYONE TO SAY BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE EVEN TODAY BELIEVE THAT CHARACTER TO BE BASED ON A DIFFERENT LAWYER NAMED BOBBY LEE COOK 
POD1000000018_S0000009	HOWEVER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THREE YEARS AFTER LARRY KING SAID SOMETHING THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD ASSUME WAS INCORRECT THE CREATOR OF MATLOCK DID CONFIRM THAT THE CHARACTER WAS BASED ON PERCY FOREMAN 
POD1000000018_S0000010	A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY FROM HOUSTON TEXAS WHO LOST ONLY FIFTY-THREE OF THE FIFTEEN HUNDRED CASES WHERE CLIENTS OF HIS FACED THE DEATH PENALTY WITH ONLY ONE OF THOSE LOSSES RESULTING IN AN ACTUAL EXECUTION 
POD1000000018_S0000012	PERCY WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS RECORD BY BEING AN INCREDIBLE LAWYER NO DENYING IT BUT ALSO DUE TO THE TEXAS COURT SYSTEM'S PRACTICE OF USING JURIES TO DETERMINE GUILT AS WELL AS SENTENCING IN THE CASE OF A GUILTY VERDICT 
POD1000000018_S0000014	SO INSTEAD OF ONE JUDGE WHO'S HEARD IT ALL BEFORE DETERMINING HIS CLIENT'S FATE 
POD1000000018_S0000016	PERCY HAD TWELVE AVERAGE CITIZENS FROM THE LOCAL COMMUNITY SITTING RIGHT THERE WAITING TO BE CONVINCED THAT THE VICTIM IN THIS SITUATION WASN'T A VICTIM AT ALL 
POD1000000018_S0000017	THEY WERE UP TO NO GOOD THE COMMUNITY WAS FAR BETTER OFF WITHOUT THAT ELEMENT IN IT AND EVEN IF HIS CLIENT HAD KILLED THEM WELL HELL THEY HATED KILLING 
POD1000000018_S0000019	FOREMAN CALLED IT MISDEMEANOR MURDER THAT'S WHERE A JURY MIGHT CONVICT YOU OF ENDING ANOTHER PERSON'S LIFE AND SEND YOU ON YOUR WAY WITH THE TYPE OF PUNISHMENT YOU'D RECEIVE FOR A MISDEMEANOR CRIME 
POD1000000018_S0000020	OFTEN NOTHING MORE THAN PROBATION NO TIME AT ALL IT'S ESSENTIALLY A SANCTIONED FORM OF VIGILANTE JUSTICE 
POD1000000018_S0000021	PERCY FOREMAN HAD SUCH A LONG RUN OF WINS WITH THIS STRATEGY THAT IT'S STILL BEING USED IN TEXAS TODAY PEOPLE WHO HAVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS SORT OF THING WILL SOMETIMES REFER TO IT AS THE TEXAS DEFENSE

POD1000000018_S0000030	WITHIN TWENTY YEARS DENNY HAD WORKED HIS WAY UP TO DIRECTOR OF THE ARTISTS SERVICE BUREAU AT W S M WHICH MEANT HE WAS IN CHARGE OF BOOKING THE ACTS ON THE OPRY 
POD1000000018_S0000032	THERE'S A FEW FUNNY THINGS FROM JIM DENNY'S TIME AT THE GRAND OLE OPRY LIKE THE ONE ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY'S BIG DEBUT 
POD1000000018_S0000033	ELVIS WAS STILL A TEENAGER WHEN DENNY DID SAM PHILLIPS THE FAVOR OF LETTING ELVIS COME ON THE SHOW TO PLAY HIS NOT-COUNTRY ARRANGEMENT OF BLUE MOON OF KENTUCKY

POD1000000018_S0000039	CASH MENTIONED THAT HE PRESENTLY HAD A SONG CALLED I WALK THE LINE IN THE TOP TEN 
POD1000000018_S0000041	JIM DENNY WAS WHAT MANY PEOPLE REFERRED TO IN THOSE TIMES AS A HARD MAN TODAY I THINK THEY'D HAVE SOME DIFFERENT WORDS FOR HIM AND THAT'S WHY ERNEST TUBB TRIED TO SHOOT HIM IN NINETEEN FIFTY-SEVEN

POD1000000018_S0000059	IT'S ALSO VERY SPECIFICALLY WHAT CAUSED HIM THREE DECADES LATER TO WANT TO SHOOT A THREE FIFTY-SEVEN MAGNUM AT JIM DENNY 
POD1000000018_S0000061	IN NINETEEN THIRTY-THREE JIMMIE RODGERS DIED YOUNG OF TUBERCULOSIS SYMPTOMS HE WAS THIRTY-FIVE

POD1000000018_S0000069	ERNEST WAS MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK HARD IF IT KEPT HIM MOVING TOWARD THE LIFE OF HIS HERO JIMMIE RODGERS 
POD1000000018_S0000070	HE'D HAD THIS SMALL PICTURE OF JIMMIE FOR YEARS NOW AND IT WAS IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE SO HE GOT A PHONE BOOK AND LOOKED UP THE NUMBER FOR JIMMIE RODGER'S WIDOW CARRIE 
POD1000000018_S0000071	HE CALLED HER ON THE PHONE TO EXPLAIN THAT HE WAS SUCH A BIG FAN AND TO SEE IF SHE HAPPENED TO HAVE A BIGGER BETTER PHOTO OF JIMMIE THAT ERNEST COULD HAVE MAYBE EVEN ONE THAT WAS AUTOGRAPHED

POD1000000018_S0000089	JUMPING RIGHT BACK INTO HIS NORMAL ROUTINE RE-INJURED HIS THROAT

POD1000000018_S0000100	NOW THE PART OF ERNEST YOU CAN HEAR IN GEORGE IS THE TENDENCY TO HOLD ON TO A NOTE FOR LONGER THAN YOU'D EXPECT PICKING THE MELODY UP AND PUTTING IT BACK DOWN IN WAYS THAT ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHEN HEARING THEM SING A SONG FOR THE FIRST TIME 
POD1000000018_S0000101	NO MATTER IF IT'S A SONG YOU'VE HEARD PERFORMED BY OTHER PEOPLE

POD1000000018_S0000166	THAT'S NOT WHAT HAPPENED HANK WILLIAMS DIED FOUR MONTHS AFTER BEING DISMISSED FROM THE OPRY IT'S TRAGIC BUT YOU CAN SEE HOW JIM DENNY THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING IN THAT SITUATION

POD1000000018_S0000178	IF JIM DENNY OWNS A COUNTRY MUSIC PUBLISHING FIRM WHILE RETAINING SINGULAR CONTROL OF THE MOST POPULAR COUNTRY MUSIC RADIO PROGRAM IN AMERICA THEN HE'S ESSENTIALLY PRINTING HIS OWN MONEY

POD1000000018_S0000198	IT'S HARD NOT TO SEE THAT AS A GIANT MIDDLE FINGER CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF COACHELLA SET UP A FESTIVAL EIGHT MILES AWAY FROM BONNAROO ON THE SAME WEEKEND FOR FREE 
POD1000000018_S0000199	IT WOULD CRUSH BONNAROO THIS WAS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE JIMMIE RODGERS MEMORIAL FESTIVAL THE FOLLOWING YEAR 
POD1000000018_S0000200	THEY REGROUPED TO PUT ONE ON AGAIN IN NINETEEN FIFTY-NINE BUT CARRIE RODGERS HEALTH HAD ALREADY TAKEN A TURN FOR THE WORSE AND ERNEST TUBB WAS NEVER INVOLVED WITH THE FESTIVAL AGAIN

POD1000000018_S0000261	IT'S JUST THAT'S NOT REALISTIC 
POD1000000018_S0000262	I BELIEVE ERNEST CHOSE TO TURN VISITORS AWAY BECAUSE HE WAS WASTING AWAY IS EMPHYSEMA AND DIDN'T WANT ANYONE WHO LOVED HIM TO HAVE THAT AS THEIR LAST MEMORY OF HIM

POD1000000022_S0000006	IMAGINE GOING THROUGH SOMETHING SIMILAR TODAY AND IF YOU MADE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE TELL ME YOU WOULDN'T BE PART OF SOME SORT OF ADVOCACY GROUP FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CURRENTLY GOING THROUGH IT THINK ABOUT IT YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE TO BE BORN IMAGINE BEING ROUNDED UP AGAINST YOUR WILL AND BEING ROCKETED OFF TO SOME ALIEN PLANET YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT 
POD1000000022_S0000007	YOU FIND YOURSELF ONCE YOU GET ON THAT PLANET ABSORBED INTO SOME FOREIGN TRIBE YOU DON'T SPEAK THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ANYTHING IS YOU YOU THINK THE REMOTE CONTROL TO THEIR T V IS FOOD YOU'RE COMPLETELY DEFENSELESS AND WHO DO YOU HAVE AS TEACHERS ON THIS JOURNEY 
POD1000000022_S0000008	WHAT JUST SOME RANDOM MAN AND WOMAN THAT HAPPEN TO LOOK LIKE YOU DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL FOR THIS STUFF BEING A BABY BEING A BABY IS LIKE GOING TO THE WORLD'S WORST COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TEACHERS THEY JUST PULL SOME RANDOM PEOPLE OFF THE STREET AND SAY AH TEACH THESE KIDS ABOUT ROCKET SCIENCE GO 
POD1000000022_S0000009	EXCEPT IT'S WORSE THAN THAT WE'RE NOT JUST LEARNING ABOUT ROCKET SCIENCE WE'RE LEARNING EVERYTHING ABOUT WHAT IT IS TO EXIST HOW WE LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLE HOW WE LOOK AT THE WORLD HOW WE LOOK AT OURSELVES WITHIN THAT WORLD WHAT I'M SAYING IS THE STRUGGLE FOR US FORMER BABIES OUT HERE WAS REAL 
POD1000000022_S0000010	AND I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT WHEN YOU'RE LIVING IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS CHAOTIC WORLD AS A BABY JUST TRY TO FIGURE THINGS OUT NO ONE'S REALLY BLAMING YOU FOR JUST SORT OF GOING ALONG WITH A LOT OF THE WAYS PEOPLE WERE DOING THINGS AROUND YOU 
POD1000000022_S0000011	THERE'S A LOT TO FIGURE OUT AND A LOT OF THESE WAYS WE'VE LEARNED TO MAKE SENSE OF STUFF ARE TOTALLY ARBITRARY A LOT OF THE WAYS WE THINK ABOUT STUFF HAVE JUST BEEN SORT OF ALMOST BY ACCIDENT PASSED DOWN FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION PHILOSOPHERS REALIZED THIS 
POD1000000022_S0000012	AND AT THE TIME OF SARTRE FOR OVER THREE HUNDRED YEARS PEOPLE HAD BEEN POINTING OUT HOW MANY OF THE WAYS WE LOOK AT THINGS IN THE WESTERN WORLD ARE LARGELY DERIVATIVE FROM THE WAY CHRISTIANITY DESCRIBES BEING A HUMAN BEING 
POD1000000022_S0000013	THAT'S HOW ENTRENCHED RELIGION WAS IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE BACK THEN AND THAT EVEN IF YOU'VE NEVER BEEN TO CHURCH EVEN IF YOUR FAMILY'S FIFTEEN GENERATIONS REMOVED FROM EVER HAVING STEPPED FOOT IN A CHURCH SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE SO FOUNDATIONAL THAT GENERATION AFTER GENERATION OF CONFUSED BABY TRY TO FIGURE THINGS OUT 
POD1000000022_S0000014	JUST WENT ALONG WITH CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT EXISTENCE THAT HAVE THEIR ORIGINS IN CHRISTIANITY FOR EXAMPLE AH THERE'S A CERTAIN REVELATORY WAY THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT IMPORTANT CROSSROADS IN LIFE RIGHT LIKE FOR EXAMPLE THEY'LL SAY 
POD1000000022_S0000015	OKAY SO I NEED TO CHOOSE A CAREER PATH FOR MY LIFE I NEED TO DECLARE A MAJOR BIG DECISION WHAT DO I DO WELL WHENEVER I CLOSE MY EYES AND THINK ABOUT WHAT I WANT I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT I CAN'T MAKE THAT BIG OF A DECISION YEAH I'VE NARROWED IT DOWN TO A FEW THINGS 
POD1000000022_S0000016	BUT HOW CAN I EVER KNOW 
POD1000000022_S0000018	I CAN SPEND HOURS A DAY THINKING ABOUT THIS STUFF I HAVE FAITH IT'S GONNA COME TO ME SOME DAY I HAVE FAITH THAT I'M GONNA WAKE UP ONE DAY SOMETHINGS GONNA HAPPEN TO ME SOME LIFE EVENT IS GOING TO OCCUR 
POD1000000022_S0000020	I'M GONNA REALIZE MY CALLING IN LIFE IN THAT MOMENT PEOPLE DO THIS SAME THING WITH RELATIONSHIPS THEY'LL SAY I HAVE THIS VAGUE IDEA UP IN MY HEAD OF MY ONE AND ONLY SOMEONE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE GONNA BE LIKE BUT I'M CONFIDENT ONE DAY I'M GONNA MEET SOMEONE 
POD1000000022_S0000021	AND THERE'S GONNA BE THIS MOMENT WHEN I LOOK AT THEM AND I REALIZE THEY'RE THE PERSON I WANNA SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH PEOPLE DO THIS WITH ANYTHING THEY THEY'LL DO IT WITH MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE ONE DAY I'M GONNA WATCH THE RIGHT PERSON SCREAMING AT ME TO BE A BETTER PERSON 
POD1000000022_S0000022	AND FROM THEN ON OUT IT'S GONNA BE EASY FOR ME TO GO TO THE GYM AND EAT PINE CONES FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE IN OTHER WORDS THERE'S A CERTAIN REVELATORY WAY THAT SOME PEOPLE LOOK AT LIFE CHOICES THAT SOME THINKERS BELIEVE IS A LONG LOST RELIC OF THE REVELATORY WAY WE USED TO THINK ABOUT THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000023	THAT A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO HAVE WHEN NAVIGATING YOUR LIFE IS THAT ONE DAY YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP AND THERE'S GONNA BE SOME EVENT SOME MIRACLE THAT YOU WITNESS SOME TRANSCENDENT MOMENT WHERE YOU REALIZE THE DIVINITY OF JESUS 
POD1000000022_S0000024	IF YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF EXISTENCE JUST YOU KNOW FORWARD THEM TO THE POPE'S INBOX THAT'S A REASONABLE THING TO EXPECT IN THAT WORLDVIEW WELL THIS ISN'T THE ONLY EXAMPLE OF THESE LONG LOST REMNANTS OF CHRISTIANITY IN OUR THINKING 
POD1000000022_S0000025	AND ANOTHER MAJOR ONE ANOTHER ONE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD STILL USE TO MAKE SENSE OF THINGS IS THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK AT THEMSELVES AND WHO THEY ARE JUST LIKE IN CHRISTIANITY WHERE YES YOU HAVE A BODY BUT YOUR TRUE SELF IS A SOUL 
POD1000000022_S0000026	IT'S AN ETERNAL SPIRIT HIDDEN DEEP DOWN WITHIN THAT BODY THAT YOU HAVE AN INTIMATE ACCESS TO JUST LIKE THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE IN TODAY'S WORLD THINK OF THEIR TRUE SELF OR THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU AS A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN US THAT ONLY WE AND OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS HAVE ACCESS TO 
POD1000000022_S0000027	YOU KNOW THEY'LL SAY THINGS LIKE SURE WHEN I'M OUT IN PUBLIC I DO KIND OF PUT ON A MASK TO OTHER PEOPLE FOR THE SAKE OF SOCIAL UTILITY I MEAN I DON'T ACT LIKE MY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT TRUE SELF IN THE STARBUCKS DRIVE THRU 
POD1000000022_S0000028	YEAH I TELL PEOPLE THINGS THEY WANT TO HEAR I PLAY THE GAME BECAUSE LOOK THE FACT IS IT'S JUST NOT USEFUL TOO 
POD1000000022_S0000029	NOT TO MENTION I DON'T REALLY FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING A HUNDRED PERCENT OF MY TRUE SELF TO THE PERSON IN THE STARBUCKS DRIVE THRU WHO AM I REALLY THOUGH WELL THAT'S SOMETHING I RESERVE FOR MY FAMILY MY CLOSEST FRIENDS IN FACT EVEN SOME OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING ABOUT THE DEPTHS OF WHAT IT IS TO BE ME 
POD1000000022_S0000030	MAYBE FOR SOME OF YOU OUT THERE THERE'S ONLY ONE OTHER PERSON IN THIS ENTIRE WORLD THAT HAS FULL ACCESS TO YOUR TRUE SELF HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY IS THIS REALLY HOW THE SELF WORKS 
POD1000000022_S0000031	IS THE SELF REALLY LIKE THE CHRISTIAN SOUL HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO SARTRE WOULD SAY IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU PUT ON A MASK WHEN YOU GO OUT IN PUBLIC FOR THE SAKE OF PRAGMATISM AND IT VERY WELL MAY BE THAT YOU'VE REFLECTED ON YOURSELF 
POD1000000022_S0000032	AND YOU HAVE THIS IDEA UP YOUR HEAD OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S ONLY ACCESSED BY YOU AND YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS BUT DON'T IGNORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE LEVELS OF DECEPTION GOING ON THERE MAYBE YOU'RE TELLING YOURSELF A STORY YOU WANT TO HEAR THE SAME WAY YOU'RE TELLING THE STARBUCKS BARISTA A STORY 
POD1000000022_S0000033	THIS CONCEPT IS A COMMON ONE IN EXISTENTIALISM IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF THE MAIN THEMES IN DOSTOYEVSKY'S BOOK CRIME AND PUNISHMENT THE IDEA THAT YOU KNOW WE OFTEN THINK WE KNOW A LOT MORE ABOUT OURSELVES THAN WE ACTUALLY DO IN PRACTICE TWO EXAMPLES OF THIS 
POD1000000022_S0000034	AH BEAR WITH ME FOR A SECOND ON THE FIRST ONE'S A LITTLE CARTOONISH BUT I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE TO PULL US OUT OF THIS CONDITIONED WAY WE OFTEN LOOK AT THE SELF AND IT GET'S US TO HONESTLY START ASKING THIS QUESTION WHERE IS THIS SELF THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY LOCATED 
POD1000000022_S0000035	FIRST EXAMPLE IMAGINE A GUY THAT THINKS HE'S NAPOLEON YOU KNOW HE SPENDS ALL DAY EVERY DAY DRESSING UP IN PARISIAN MILITARY GARB HE BUILDS A BUNCKER OUT OF COUCH CUSHIONS IN HIS FRONT ROOM AGONIZING TO HIMSELF HOW AM I GOING TO CONQUER MOSCOW 
POD1000000022_S0000036	THAT GUY NOW THIS MAN BELIEVES BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT THAT HE IS NAPOLEON IF YOU SET HIM DOWN AND THEN ASKED HIM CANDIDLY NO BUT WHO ARE YOU REALLY DEEP DOWN INSIDE HE WOULD SAY I'M NAPOLEON BONAPARTE COMMANDER OF THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH 
POD1000000022_S0000037	HUSBAND TO A MURDERED WIFE FATHER TO A MURDERED SON AND I WILL HAVE MY VENGEANCE BUT IS THIS MAN REALLY NAPOLEON WE KNOW HE'S NOT NAPOLEON IN FACT IN A WEIRD WAY AS OUTSIDERS WE SEEM TO HAVE AN ADVANTAGE WHEN IT COMES TO KNOWING WHO HE REALLY IS 
POD1000000022_S0000038	INTERESTING HERE'S THE LESS CARTOONISH EXAMPLE AND TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS APPLIES TO YOU IMAGINE A GUY SITTING ON THE COUCH WATCHING T V WITH HIS PALS THEY TURN ON THE NEWS AND THERE'S A STORY ABOUT SOME MASS SHOOTING THAT HAPPENED AT A WALMART SOMEWHERE 
POD1000000022_S0000039	HE HEARS THE STORY GETS KIND OF ANGRY TURNS TO HIS FRIENDS AND SAYS YOU KNOW WHAT THAT GUY AND PEOPLE LIKE HIM THEY BETTER HOPE THEY NEVER SHOWS UP AT MY WALMART SOMEONE PULLS OUT A GUN WHEN I'M THERE I'M NOT GONNA BE ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ON THE NEWS CHOPPER CAMERA SCREAMING AND RUNNING OUT OF THE STORE 
POD1000000022_S0000040	I'M GOING TO THE SPORTING GOODS SECTION I MAY I'M GONNA GO UP INTO THE RAFTERS LIKE I'M TOM CRUISE AND SNAP THE DUDE'S NECK I'M GONNA DO THIS BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE KIND OF PERSON I AM THAT'S ME I'D SACRIFICE MY LIFE FOR THE GREATER GOOD NOW HE MAY TELL HIS FRIENDS THIS 
POD1000000022_S0000041	HE MAY BELIEVE THAT WHO HE IS DEEP DOWN BEYOND A SHADOW OF A DOUBT BUT IF NEXT SATURDAY HE'S OUT SHOPPING WITH HIS FAMILY SOMEONE PULLS OUT A GUN AND ALL HIS WIFE AND KIDS SEE IS A A POOF OF SMOKE AND HE'S RUNNING OUT THE BACK DOOR WHO IS THAT GUY REALLY 
POD1000000022_S0000042	IN OTHER WORDS WHEN WE REFERENCE THIS THING WE CALL OUR SELF INTUITIVELY IT CAN FEEL LIKE WELL I AM MY SELF I KNOW WHO I AM SO NO ONE CAN TELL ME WHO I AM BUT ME 
POD1000000022_S0000043	IN FACT IF YOU JUST RECITED THAT STATEMENT IN MOST PUBLIC SETTINGS PEOPLE WOULD BE LIKE YEAH YEAH YOU TELL THEM ONLY YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE DEEP DOWN INSIDE BUT IS THAT A DELUSION IS THAT JUST A NARRATIVE THAT WE TELL OURSELVES TO SIMPLIFY THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF 
POD1000000022_S0000044	SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE SELF IT'S NOT A SOUL IT'S NOT A PERSONALITY HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SELF TURNS OUT TO BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT WITH ME MORE MOVING PARTS 
POD1000000022_S0000045	AND I THINK A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN IF WE WANNA UNDERSTAND SARTRE'S VIEWS ON WHAT THE SELF REALLY IS IS TO TALK ABOUT TWO FOUNDATIONAL ASPECTS OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A HUMAN BEING THAT TO SARTRE SEEM TO BE CONSTANTLY INTERTWINED AND DEPENDENT UPON EACH OTHER WHAT HE CALLS OUR FACTICITY 
POD1000000022_S0000046	AND OUR TRANSCENDENCE IF YOU ARE A HUMAN BEING THAT'S ALIVE RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE BOTH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE PUT VERY SIMPLY OUR FACTICITY IS THE COLLECTION OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT 
POD1000000022_S0000047	AND TRANSCENDENCE IS OUR ABILITY TO CHANGE OR THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE AT OUR DISPOSAL LET'S BREAK IT DOWN FURTHER THOUGH REMEMBER LAST TIME WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT BEING IN ITSELF VERSUS BEING FOR ITSELF BEING IN ITSELF AS BEING KIND OF LIKE MATTER THIS INERT FEATURELESS BLOB OF EXISTENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000048	FULLY AFFIRMATIVE AND BEING FOR ITSELF AS BEING CONSCIOUSNESS OR THE SOURCE OF ALL NEGATION WELL ONE DAY WHEN SARTRE'S TRYING TO MEET HIS MONTHLY QUOTA FOR OBSCURE SOUNDING PHILOSOPHICAL DESCRIPTIONS THE WAY HE DESCRIBES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES IS THAT BEING IN ITSELF 
POD1000000022_S0000049	QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF QUOTE IS WHAT IT IS NOT WELL AS WEIRD AS THAT SOUNDS IN A VACUUM AFTER LISTENING TO LAST EPISODE WE ALL KNOW WHAT HE MEANS WHEN HE SAYS IT BUT THEN SARTRE POINTS OUT SOMETHING VERY MYSTERIOUS A VERY STRANGE COINCIDENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000050	WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORIES TWO THINGS THAT ARE EASY TO WRITE OFF AS JUST THESE MEANINGLESS ABSTRACT CONCEPTS THAT SARTRE COOKED UP ONE DAY WHEN YOU LOOK AT HOW BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF RELATE TO EACH OTHER 
POD1000000022_S0000051	SARTRE NOTICES THERE SEEMS TO BE A SIMILAR SORT OF RELATIONSHIP AT THE FOUNDATION OF WHO WE ARE AS PEOPLE SEE BECAUSE ON ONE HAND ALL OF US HAVE OUR FACTICITY AND FACTICITY IS KIND OF LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IT'S THE FULLY AFFIRMATIVE SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US 
POD1000000022_S0000052	YOU ASK ME WHO I AM AND OFTENTIMES I WILL STATE THE FACTS ABOUT MYSELF OH I AM ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTEEN YEARS OLD THAT'S A FACT I AM A HORSE WRANGLER BY PROFESSION THAT'S A FACT I MAKE TWENTY-EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR I DRIVE A FORD FOCUS 
POD1000000022_S0000053	I I I'M SCARED OF SPIDERS THINGS LIKE THAT RIGHT IN OTHER WORDS STATEMENTS OF FACTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY TRUE ABOUT US THAT'S WHAT MAKES UP OUR FACTICITY BUT WHAT SARTRE WOULD WANT US TO CONSIDER IS THAT WHILE THESE KINDS OF STATEMENTS ARE NO DOUBT USEFUL WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING CERTAIN PIECES OF WHO I AM 
POD1000000022_S0000054	THEY NEVER TELL US THE FULL STORY AND THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE HUMAN BEINGS ARE FAR MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT TO FULLY UNDERSTAND A HUMAN BEING JUST BY DEFAULT IS TO UNDERSTAND A TYPE OF BEING THAT HAS POSSIBILITIES NONE OF US ARE PURE FACTICITY IN OTHER WORDS 
POD1000000022_S0000055	THE ONLY TIME A HUMAN BEING IS PURE FACTICITY IS WHEN THEY'RE DEAD YES WE HAVE A SET OF FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT US RIGHT NOW BUT WE ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE INTO SOMETHING ELSE AND IF WE'RE TRYING TO DESCRIBE THE SELF IF WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE PICTURE OF WHO SOMEONE IS 
POD1000000022_S0000056	THE CHOICES WE MAKE ABOUT WHICH OF THESE POSSIBILITIES WE'RE GONNA BRING ABOUT END UP BEING JUST AS IMPORTANT AS THE FACTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE RIGHT NOW FOR EXAMPLE IF I'M GOING TO SCHOOL TO BECOME AN I T CONSULTANT OR IF I'M TRAINING FOR A MARATHON OR IF I'M LOSING A BUNCH OF WEIGHT FOR WEDDING PICTURES 
POD1000000022_S0000057	A BIG PART OF UNDERSTANDING WHO I AM IS UNDERSTANDING THE THING I'M ACTIVELY TRYING TO CHANGE INTO AN I T CONSULTANT A MARATHON RUNNER IN OTHER WORDS PART OF UNDERSTANDING THE FULL PICTURE OF ME IS UNDERSTANDING WHAT I AM NOT YET 
POD1000000022_S0000058	YOU CAN START TO HEAR THE WEIRD SARTRE DESCRIPTION CREEPING IN THERE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS AND BEING FOR ITSELF IS WHAT IT IS NOT IN A SENSE I AM WHAT I AM I HAVE A FACTICITY BUT I ALSO AM WHAT I AM NOT YET 
POD1000000022_S0000059	WHEN I CONSIDER MY TRANSCENDENCE JUST LIKE BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF THESE TWO ASPECTS OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A HUMAN BEING FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE ARE ENTANGLED INTERTWINED AND IN SOME CASES RELIANT ON EACH OTHER FOR THEIR VERY EXISTENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000060	YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE ARE CONSTANTLY AFFECTING EACH OTHER AND THAT'S BECAUSE THE FACTS OF YOUR LIFE ARE OFTEN TIMES CAUSED BY WHAT POSSIBILITIES YOU DECIDE TO BRING ABOUT AND THE POSSIBILITIES YOU'VE DECIDED TO EXPLORE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS LIMITED BY THE FACTS OF YOUR LIFE 
POD1000000022_S0000061	LET'S STOP WITH THE HYPOTHETICALS AND GIVE A REAL EXAMPLE ALRIGHT ME I'LL USE ME AS AN EXAMPLE I AM SIX FEET TALL A HUNDRED SEVENTY-TWO POINT TWO POUNDS THIS MORNING NOW NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO 
POD1000000022_S0000062	I AM NEVER GOING TO BECOME A HORSE JOCKEY IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN FOR ME AS LONG AS THERE'RE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT ARE FOUR FOUR EIGHT EIGHTY-FIVE POUNDS THE FACTICITY THAT I'M A CERTAIN HEIGHT AND WEIGHT LIMITS MY ABILITY TO TRANSCEND AND THE RESULT OF THAT IS 
POD1000000022_S0000063	I'M NEVER WINNING THE KENTUCKY DERBY IT'S NOT HAPPENING THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW OUR ABILITY TO TRANSCEND IS OFTEN TIMES LIMITED BY THE FACTS ABOUT US ANOTHER EXAMPLE I WAS BORN WITH A PARTICULAR FACE AND A PARTICULAR ABILITY TO PUT ON MUSCLE 
POD1000000022_S0000064	NO MATTER HOW MUCH I WANT TO I AM NEVER GOING TO BE AN INSTAGRAM MODEL THE THE FACTICITY OF MY FACE MY AH MY FACTICITY AND AND ALL THE OTHER STUFF GOING ON THERE 
POD1000000022_S0000065	LOOK I WILL NEVER BE THE KIND OF PERSON THAT PEOPLE WANNA VOLUNTARILY LOOK AT AND THEN CLICK AN EMOJI THAT SIGNIFIES HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT THE MOST RECENT PICTURE OF ME IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AND THESE FACTS ABOUT ME ARE THE PARAMETERS I LIVE MY LIFE AND EXERCISE MY FREEDOM WITHIN SEE BECAUSE THAT'S THE THING AND THIS GOES FOR ALL OF YOU OUT THERE 
POD1000000022_S0000066	WHEN SARTRE TALKS ABOUT RADICAL FREEDOM WHEN ANY OF US TALK ABOUT BEING INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE FREE TO ACT AS THEY CHOOSE WE'RE NEVER TALKING ABOUT TOTAL FREEDOM RIGHT IT'S ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS 
POD1000000022_S0000067	YOU KNOW WE OFTEN SAY THINGS LIKE I CAN DO WHATEVER I WANT TO DO BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO DO RIGHT I MEAN ULTIMATELY YOU'RE A HUMAN BEING YOU CAN'T WRAP YOURSELF IN A PROTECTIVE COCOON AND THEN EMERGE A UNICORN IN THREE DAYS YOU CAN'T FLY TO THE EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE AND LOOK AT WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE 
POD1000000022_S0000068	NO FREEDOM IS ALWAYS FREEDOM WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND IT'S THOSE LIMITATIONS THAT GIVE A LOT OF WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO IN LIFE IT'S VALUE WE SEE THIS IN ALL THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT FORMS OF ART YOU KNOW WHEN SOMEONE WRITES A REALLY GOOD HAIKU 
POD1000000022_S0000069	WE SEE IT AS GOOD NOT BECAUSE THEY'RE THE GREATEST WORDS THAT COULD EVER HAVE BEEN POSSIBLY STRUNG TOGETHER NOW THE BEAUTY OF THE HAIKU IS BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE GIVEN AN ARTIST TOTAL FREEDOM WITHIN A SET OF LIMITATIONS THAT WE IMPOSE 
POD1000000022_S0000070	FIVE SYLLABLES SEVEN SYLLABLES FIVE SYLLABLES GO IN OTHER WORDS THE LIMITATIONS ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT MAKES THE HAIKU BEAUTIFUL AND THIS APPLIES TO LIFE AS WELL 
POD1000000022_S0000071	THE FACTICITY THAT YOU WERE BORN INTO YOUR OWN INDIVIDUAL LIMITATIONS ARE ALWAYS GOING TO AFFECT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE AND WHAT YOU ULTIMATELY CHOOSE TO DO WITH YOUR LIFE SO TRY TO LIVE YOUR LIFE LIKE IT'S A PIECE OF ART YOU'RE CREATING UM 
POD1000000022_S0000072	BUT YEAH ULTIMATELY THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING HERE WITH THE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCEIS IT'S NOT ONLY TO STOP THINKING ABOUT YOUR SELF AS THOUGH IT'S THIS ARTIFACT HIDDEN DEEP WITHIN YOU INSIDE OF A VAULT BUT ALSO STOP THINKING ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AS THOUGH IT'S THIS STATIC 
POD1000000022_S0000073	UNCHANGING THING THAT YOU CAN POINT TO THE POINT THAT IS MAKING IS THAT WHO YOU ARE IS ALWAYS IN A STATE OF CONSTANT CHANGE SOMETIMES SMALL CHANGES SOMETIMES BIGGER CHANGES BUT CHANGING AND IN FLUX BUT DON'T GO EXTREME IN THE OTHER DIRECTION 
POD1000000022_S0000074	DON'T START THINKING OF YOUR SELF AS THIS ETHEREAL THING THAT CAN NEVER BE DEFINED AGAIN ALL THE WAY UP UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE WHEN YOU'RE FINALLY TURNED INTO TOTAL FACTICITY YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE CERTAIN FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND CERTAIN POSSIBILITIES AT YOUR DISPOSAL TO BRING ABOUT 
POD1000000022_S0000075	UNLESS IF YOU'RE DEAD YOU'VE NEVER ARRIVED AT A DESTINATION AS A HUMAN BEING NOW AT FIRST GLANCE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE SARTRE'S WRITING A SELF HELP BOOK NO NO SINGLE FACT ABOUT YOU SUMS UP WHO YOU ARE RELEASE YOUR INNER TRANSCENDENCE NO 
POD1000000022_S0000076	NO LIKE WE TOUCHED ON LAST TIME SARTRE THINKS THAT WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRULY FACED WITH THE NUMBER OF THESE POSSIBILITIES ARE FREE TO CHOOSE FROM MOST OF THE TIME THEY DON'T GET EXCITED THEY'RE HORRIFIED BY IT IN FACT MOST OF THE TIME ONCE PEOPLE REALIZE THIS STUFF 
POD1000000022_S0000077	SARTRE THINKS THAT THE SECRET COVERT DESIRE OF EVERYONE WHETHER THEY REALIZE IT OR NOT IS TO ESCAPE THIS DUALITY IT'S TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE OR AS SARTRE SAYS WE ALL SECRETLY WANT TO BECOME GOD 
POD1000000022_S0000078	LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS BY THAT THINK ABOUT THE WAY FOLLOWERS OF THE ABRAHAMIC RELIGIONS HAVE TRADITIONALLY LOOKED AT GOD WHAT IS IT LIKE TO BE GOD WELL GOD IS PERFECT GOD IS IN THIS MOMENT EVERYTHING HE WILL EVER BE IF GOD HAD A JOB INTERVIEW AND THE PERSON ASKED HIM WHAT'S ONE THING YOU'D CHANGE ABOUT YOURSELF 
POD1000000022_S0000079	GOD LITERALLY DOESN'T HAVE AN ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION BUT THEN ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL WITH THE SNAP OF HIS FINGERS HE CAN DO ANYTHING HE WANTS TO DO IN OTHER WORDS IN THIS OLD STYLE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF WHAT GOD IS ON ONE HAND 
POD1000000022_S0000080	GOD IS PERFECT AS HE IS PURE FACTICITY BUT ON THE OTHER HAND GOD IS ALL POWERFUL AND CAPABLE OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY POSSIBILITY HE WANTS IN OTHER WORDS PURE TRANSCENDENCE SARTRE WOULD SAY THIS IS NO COINCIDENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000081	AND IT'S ALSO NO COINCIDENCE THAT AS PEOPLE NAVIGATE THEIR LIVES THEY HAVE ALL SORTS OF TACTICS THEY USE TO TURN THEMSELVES EITHER INTO SOMEBODY THAT IGNORES THEIR POSSIBILITIES AND ARE PERFECT AS THEY ARE RIGHT NOW OR SOMEONE WHO IGNORES THE VERY REAL UNFORTUNATE FACTS ABOUT THEMSELVES 
POD1000000022_S0000082	AND THEY STAY LOST IN THESE UNATTAINABLE DREAMS THEIR ENTIRE LIFE THIS IS THE CONTEXT WE NEEDED TO UNDERSTAND A CONCEPT WE TALKED ABOUT WELL OVER A YEAR AGO ON THE ONE EPISODE WE DID ON SARTRE THE PRIMARY TACTIC THAT PEOPLE USE IN THEIR LIVES TO TURN THEMSELVES INTO EITHER PURE FACTICITY 
POD1000000022_S0000083	OR PURE TRANSCENDENCE LIKE GOD IS WHAT SARTRE CALLS BAD FAITH LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT THE MOST FAMOUS EXAMPLE OF BAD FAITH THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT BECAUSE WE ALREADY TALKED ABOUT IT IN THE OTHER EPISODE I'LL KEEP IT BRIEF 
POD1000000022_S0000084	SARTRE TALKS ABOUT SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF A CAFE IN PARIS WATCHING A WAITER AS HE DOES HIS JOB THEN YOU CAN IMAGINE A WAITER IN THE NINETEEN FORTIES RIGHT DRESSED UP IN HIS LITTLE OUTFIT VERY UPRIGHT GOOD POSTURE VERY PROPER 
POD1000000022_S0000085	HE HOLDS THE TRAY IN A PARTICULAR WAY HE WALKS AND CHANGES DIRECTION IN A VERY MILITARISTIC PARTICULAR WAY LIKE A GOOD WAITER DOES SARTRE CAN'T HELP BUT POINT OUT THAT THIS GUY DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A SELF WITH FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE IN THIS MOMENT 
POD1000000022_S0000086	HE SEEMS TO HAVE RELEGATED HIMSELF TO JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A WAITER HE'S GOING TO THE MOTIONS TRYING TO TURN HIMSELF INTO PURE FACTICITY JUST A WAITER AND NOTHING ELSE NOW EVEN THOUGH WAITERS DON'T ACT LIKE THIS OFTEN IN TODAY'S WORLD 
POD1000000022_S0000087	GO TO MOST RESTAURANTS AND YOU CAN FIND SOME MODERN VERSION OF WHAT SARTRE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY SERVERS OUT THERE THAT HAVE FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND ARE JUST SORT OF PLAYING THE ROLE OF THE SAME PERSON IT SEEMS TO BE A MODERN ARCHETYPE OF WHAT IT IS TO BE A SERVER THEY ALL SAY THE SAME STUFF 
POD1000000022_S0000088	HI I'M JOHN I'M GONNA BE TAKING CARE YOU TODAY CAN I GET YOU GUYS STARTED WITH A BOTTOMLESS BUCKET OF SHRIMP OR SOME DRINKS OR SOMETHING BUT IT'S AT EVERY STAGE OF THE MEAL HOW'S EVERYTHING TASTING FOR YOU GUYS YOU ALL SAVE ROOM FOR DESERT THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO RUSH I'M GONNA LEAVE THE CHECK HERE I'M GONNA GO OVER THERE 
POD1000000022_S0000090	ASK YOURSELF IS THIS THE WAY THIS GUY TALKS TO HIS MOM IS THIS THE WAY HE TALKS TO HIS BEST FRIENDS NO HE'S FALLEN INTO BAD FAITH AND IS JUST PLAYING THE PART OF A SERVER NOW THE POINT SARTRE'S MAKING IS NOT THAT WAITERS NEED TO BE MORE CREATIVE IT'S NOT ABOUT WAITERS 
POD1000000022_S0000091	SARTRE THINKS THAT AS HUMAN BEINGS WE HAVE A TENDENCY TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS THIS TRAP IN ALL ASPECTS OF OUR LIFE WE MAKE PROCLAMATIONS ABOUT WHAT WE ARE ALL THE TIME I AM A STAY AT HOME MOM THAT'S MY IDENTITY 
POD1000000022_S0000092	I AM A LIBERTARIAN I AM A MORMON AND THAT'S THAT WHAT WE'RE DESPERATELY TRYING TO DO WITH THESE PROCLAMATIONS IS GIVE OURSELVES AN ESSENCE IN A WORLD WHERE EXISTENCE PRECEDES ESSENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000093	ALL THESE THINGS ARE JUST US WANTING TO THINK ABOUT OUR SELVES AS SOME STATIC THINGS SET IN STONE AND RUN FROM THE POSSIBILITIES THAT WE HAVE NOW WHEN WE TAKE AN HONEST LOOK AT THE POSSIBILITIES AT OUR DISPOSAL IT TERRIFIES US AND PRODUCES A FEELING CALLED NAUSEA 
POD1000000022_S0000094	AND WE USE BAD FAITH TO QUELL THIS FEELING OF NAUSEA WE'RE CONSTANTLY DOING THIS WITH OURSELVES NOW IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS SARTRE'S BEING AND NOTHINGNESS YOU MIGHT GET THE READ FROM THE BOOK THAT THIS TENDENCY WE HAVE TO GRAVITATE TOWARDS BAD FAITH 
POD1000000022_S0000095	IS AN INESCAPABLE CONDITION OF BEING A HUMAN BEING AND THAT EVEN WHEN WE'RE SELF AWARE OF THE BAD FAITH WE'RE ENGAGING IN WE'RE STILL ENGAGING IN BAD FAITH IF ALL YOU EVER READ WAS THE MAIN TEXT OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS YOU MIGHT GET THAT IMPRESSION AND IT CERTAINLY SOUNDS LIKE A REALLY SAD PICTURE 
POD1000000022_S0000096	BUT IN ONE OF THE FOOTNOTES OF BEING AND NOTHINGNESS SARTRE ALLUDES TO A WAY OUT OF ALL OF IT AND PERHAPS TO AN ETHICS THAT HE'D WRITE LATER ON IN THIS LIFE WELL HE NEVER WRITES AN ETHICS UM AND IT MAY BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIS LIFELONG PARTNER 
POD1000000022_S0000097	AND FELLOW EXISTENTIALIST SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR PRODUCES WHAT MANY CONSIDER TO BE THE GREATEST EXISTENTIALIST APPROACH TO ETHICS CALLED THE ETHICS OF AMBIGUITY NEXT EPISODE IS PART TWO ONCE SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR SO WE'RE GONNA BE TALKING ALL ABOUT IT UM BUT ENOUGH OF BAD FAITH LET'S GET BACK TO ANSWERING THIS QUESTION WHO AM I 
POD1000000022_S0000098	REALLY HERE'S THE THING WHEN IT COMES TO THESE CONCEPTS OF FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT WHEN YOU JUST THINK GENERALLY ABOUT THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE WHERE ARE THOSE THINGS LOCATED WHERE ARE YOU LOOKING TO FIND THOSE 
POD1000000022_S0000099	THOSE THINGS AREN'T HIDDEN SOMEWHERE DEEP DOWN WITHIN YOU THAT ONLY YOU HAVE ACCESS TO YOU MAY HAVE A PARTICULAR PERSPECTIVE OF THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE BUT NOT ONLY DO YOU HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO SLIP INTO BAD FAITH AND TELL YOURSELF A STORY ABOUT THEM 
POD1000000022_S0000100	SARTRE WOULD SAY YOU DON'T HAVE SOME PRIVILEGED V I P ACCESS TO THE FACTS THAT ARE TRUE ABOUT YOU AND THE POSSIBILITIES THAT YOU HAVE I MEAN HYPOTHETICALLY ANY OTHER PERSON IF THEY WERE DILIGENT ENOUGH HAS ACCESS TO YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000101	IN FACT JUST LIKE THE GUY THAT TELLS HIMSELF THAT HE'S NAPOLEON SOMETIMES OTHER PEOPLE ARE BETTER AT TELLING US WHO WE ARE THAN WE ARE BUT HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE THE REASON IT'S POSSIBLE IS BECAUSE THE SELF IS NOT THE CHRISTIAN SOUL TO SARTRE 
POD1000000022_S0000102	JUST LIKE YOUR FACTICITY AND TRANSCENDENCE WHAT WE'RE REFERENCING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT OUR SELVES IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION IT'S THE CONGLOMERATION OF ALL THE THINGS YOU'VE EVER ACTUALLY DONE IN YOUR LIFE 
POD1000000022_S0000103	WHEN YOU WANT TO GET A SOLID ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I YOU DON'T REFERENCE THE STORY THAT YOU TELL YOURSELF IN YOUR HEAD THAT'S CLOUDED BY ALL SORTS OF BAD FAITH AND WISHFUL THINKING LIKE THE GUY THAT THINKS HE WOULD TRY TO TAKE DOWN THE GUNMAN AT WALMART 
POD1000000022_S0000104	NO WE TELL OURSELVES STORIES ALL THE TIME WHAT FOLLOWS FROM THIS IS THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE MEASURE OF WHO YOU ARE IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO IT'S THE COLLECTION OF WHAT YOU'VE ACTUALLY DONE THUS FAR IN YOUR LIFE AND SARTRE SAYS THAT WHEN YOU STOP LOOKING AT THE SELF 
POD1000000022_S0000105	AS THOUGH IT'S THE THING INSIDE OF YOU AND YOU START LOOKING AT IT MORE ACCURATELY AS THIS ABSTRACTION THAT'S OUTSIDE OF US WHAT YOU INEVITABLY START TO REALIZE IS THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET A FULL PICTURE OF WHO YOU ARE WITHOUT REFERENCING THE WAY THAT OTHER PEOPLE VIEW YOU 
POD1000000022_S0000106	MORE THAN THAT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVER GET A FULL PICTURE OF BEING WITHOUT REFERENCING OTHER PEOPLE AND MEAN HERE'S WHAT HE'S GETTING AT SO FAR WHEN IT COMES TO DESCRIBING BEING WE'VE BEEN PRESENTED WITH BEING IN ITSELF AND BEING FOR ITSELF BUT IT'S RIGHT HERE FAIRLY LATE IN BEING 
POD1000000022_S0000107	AND NOTHINGNESS THAT SARTRE LAYS OUT HIS THIRD ONTOLOGICAL CATEGORY WHAT HE CALLS BEING-FOR-OTHERS LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT HE MEANS SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT AN INTRINSIC PART OF WHAT IT IS TO BE YOU IS EXISTING ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE CONSEQUENCES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT 
POD1000000022_S0000108	THIS IS SARTRE'S CONCEPT OF BEING-FOR-OTHERS NOW HOW DOES BEING-FOR-OTHERS AFFECT MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO AM I WELL AGAIN THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF IS OUTSIDE OF US IT'S AN ABSTRACTION 
POD1000000022_S0000109	AND WHAT SARTRE POINTS OUT IS THAT THERE ARE MANY ASPECTS ABOUT WHO WE ARE THAT ARE GIVEN TO US BY OTHER PEOPLE FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER WE'RE TRUSTWORTHY OR NOT WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE A TRUSTWORTHY PERSON IS AN ASPECT OF WHO YOU ARE THAT'S MEDIATED BY OTHER PEOPLE RIGHT 
POD1000000022_S0000110	WHETHER I'M A NICE OR MEAN PERSON LOOK I MAY THINK OF MYSELF AS A NICE PERSON BUT IF EVERY SINGLE OTHER PERSON I ENCOUNTER ALL THROUGHOUT MY LIFE SAYS THAT I'M MEAN FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES I'M A MEAN PERSON THIS CONCEPT OF THE SELF 
POD1000000022_S0000111	AND HOW OTHER PEOPLE VIEW US SEEM TO BE CONNECTED TO SARTRE BUT THE FLIP SIDE OF IT BEING THAT INTERCONNECTED IS THAT IT LEAVES US AN WHAT HE SUBSCRIBES IS A A PERPETUAL STATE OF BEING JUDGED BY THE PEOPLE AROUND US 
POD1000000022_S0000112	WE'RE ALMOST ALWAYS BEING TURNED INTO PURE FACTICITY IN OTHER PEOPLE'S MINDS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE YOU EVER WALK AROUND IN YOURSELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT THE WAY YOU LOOK MAYBE YOU JUST GOT A NEW PAIR OF SHOES AND YOU THINK THEY LOOK WEIRD AND AS YOU'RE WALKING AROUND YOU FEEL LIKE EVERY PERSON THAT PASSES YOU IS LOOKING AT YOU AND THEY'RE THINKING 
POD1000000022_S0000113	WOW WHAT WERE THEY THINKING WHEN THEY PICKED OUT THOSE SHOES THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A PERSON THAT DOESN'T CARE VERY MUCH ABOUT THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE LOOKING AT YOU AND THEY'RE TURNING YOU INTO AN OBJECT IN THEIR SUBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE WORLD PURE FACTICITY 
POD1000000022_S0000114	YOU WILL HENCEFORTH BE KNOWN AS THE WEIRD SHOES GUY IN THAT PERSON'S MIND THIS IS CONSTANTLY GOING ON BUT SARTRE'S NOT SAYING IT'S ALWAYS BAD THAT BEING AROUND OTHER PEOPLE IS SOME PARANOID EVERYBODY'S THINKING BAD THINGS ABOUT ME ALL THE TIME THING 
POD1000000022_S0000115	PEOPLE VERY WELL MAY BE THINKING REALLY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU ALL THE TIME THE POINT THAT SARTRE WANTS TO MAKE IS THAT THIS WHOLE DYNAMIC THIS DYNAMIC OF OTHER PEOPLE SEEING YOU PUTTING YOU ON TRIAL AND TURNING YOU INTO PURE FACTICITY IN THEIR MINDS THIS IS GOING ON ALL THE TIME 
POD1000000022_S0000116	SIMPLY BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT WE EXIST ALONGSIDE OTHER PEOPLE AND THAT WHILE THE INSIGHTS OTHER PEOPLE GIVE US ABOUT WHO WE ARE ARE NO DOUBT VALUABLE WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO SLIP INTO BAD FAITH ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS DYNAMIC OF BEING FOR OTHERS WHAT I MEAN IS 
POD1000000022_S0000117	JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY SEES YOU WEARING WEIRD SHOES ONE DAY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU ARE NOW WEIRD SHOES GUY IN PERPETUITY IN OTHER WORDS DON'T SLIP INTO BAD FAITH WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT YOU NO MATTER HOW CONVENIENT IT MAY BE TO PRESCRIBE YOURSELF IN ESSENCE AND DENY YOUR TRANSCENDENCE 
POD1000000022_S0000118	DON'T TURN YOURSELF INTO PURE FACTICITY AND JUST ACCEPT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TELL YOU YOU ARE MAYBE YOU ARE WEIRD SHOES GUY RIGHT NOW BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE FUTURE BUT THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS DON'T DENY YOUR FACTICITY DON'T TELL YOURSELF YOUR SHOES ARE FINE 
POD1000000022_S0000119	DON'T TELL YOURSELF THAT YOU DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE ELSE SAYS AND THAT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK DOESN'T MATTER TO YOU AT ALL OBVIOUSLY IT DOES THAT'S SLIPPING INTO ANOTHER KIND OF BAD FAITH 
POD1000000022_S0000120	SO TO SUM THIS UP I GUESS LOOK INTUITIVELY 
POD1000000022_S0000121	IT MAY SEEM TO US LIKE WE HAVE A SORT OF SPECIAL ACCESS TO KNOWING WHO WE ARE AND THAT WE CHOOSE TO SHARE OURSELVES WITH ONLY OUR CLOSEST FRIENDS WE TRUST EARLY BUT SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS THAT WAY IS CAUSE WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE IS A NARRATIVE ABOUT YOURSELF 
POD1000000022_S0000123	PERSPECTIVE AND THAT THE REASON IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR FRIENDS REINFORCE THIS PICTURE OF WHO YOU ARE 
POD1000000022_S0000124	IS BECAUSE THAT'S THE VERY CRITERIA WE ALL USE TO CHOOSE WHO OUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE IS WHETHER OR NOT THEY REINFORCE THIS PICTURE THAT WE HAVE FOR OURSELVES THAT'S WHAT WE LIKE ABOUT OUR FRIENDS TO SARTRE 
POD1000000022_S0000125	FOR EXAMPLE IF A BIG PART OF THE WAY THAT YOU VIEW YOURSELF IN YOUR IDENTITY IS THAT YOU CONSIDER YOURSELF TO BE A SMART PERSON SARTRE WOULD PREDICT THAT MOST OF YOUR FRIENDS ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT SO SMART THAT TELL YOU THAT YOU'RE SMART ALL THE TIME 
POD1000000022_S0000126	OR PEOPLE THAT ASK YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS THAT YOU THEN ANSWER MAKING YOU FEEL SMART OR OTHER SMART PEOPLE THAT COMMEND YOU ON BEING SMART LIKE THEM TO SARTRE WE CHOOSE OUR FRIENDS BECAUSE THEY REINFORCE THE WAY THAT WE VIEW OURSELVES 
POD1000000022_S0000127	OF COURSE WE GIVE THEM PRIVILEGED ACCESS TO OUR BIASED NARRATIVE OF OURSELVES 
POD1000000022_S0000128	AND OF COURSE IT'S GONNA FEEL VALIDATING OF COURSE IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE WHO YOU ARE BUT AGAIN SARTRE WOULD SAY THAT THE TRUE MEASURE OF YOUR VALUES THE TRUE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHO ARE YOU 
POD1000000022_S0000129	IS WHAT YOU ACTUALLY DO THANK YOU FOR LISTENING I'LL TALK TO YOU NEXT TIME 
POD1000000025_S0000000	THERE'S SORT OF LIKE A BEFORE WE MET AND AN AFTER WE MET AND NO GRADIENT

POD1000000025_S0000097	BEST NEW WHATEVER 
POD1000000025_S0000098	HE GOT NAMED ONE OF THOSE BUT RAFA NEVER WOULD TAKE THAT FOR HIMSELF AND IT WAS ALWAYS LIKE US 
POD1000000025_S0000099	WE ARE AND SO LIKE WE PLAYED THOSE SHOWS TOGETHER AND LIKE WOULD END UP MAKING NO MONEY ON THESE GIGS 
POD1000000025_S0000100	BECAUSE HE WOULD BRING ME AND A BAND LIKE FOUR OR FIVE OTHER PEOPLE TO PLAY MUSIC USE THE ENTIRE FEE TO FLY US OUT TO A WHEREVER GEORGIA AND LIKE PLAY A SHOW WHERE NO-ONE WOULD MAKE ANY MONEY BUT WE GOT TO PLAY A SHOW 
POD1000000025_S0000101	HE WAS LIKE DOING THAT FROM JUMP FOR SO LONG

POD1000000025_S0000112	THAT WAS RAISED TO NOT FEED AN EGO THAT FEELS CONSTANTLY EAGER FOR FOOD 
POD1000000025_S0000114	WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THAT PERIOD IS LIKE WE WERE ALL PUSHING TO LITTLE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUCCESS 
POD1000000025_S0000115	WE'RE JUST KIND OF WEIRDOS THAT LIKE ALMOST IN A SCENE THAT WE KIND OF MAKE SENSE IN 
POD1000000025_S0000116	THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND DIGGS VERY MUCH AT ALL I FEEL LIKE THE MORE COMMERCIAL BAY AREAS SCENE 
POD1000000025_S0000117	AND THEY ONLY SORT OF UNDERSTOOD ME LIKE IT WAS VERY LIKE YEAH YEAH YOU'RE IN BUT LIKE DON'T TRY TO MAKE ANY CHANGES YOU KNOW 
POD1000000025_S0000118	AND I THINK THAT'S A BIG REASON THAT WE WENT TO L A 
POD1000000025_S0000119	WE COULD SEE THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND IT'S NOT GETTING ANY FRIENDLIER OR MORE RECEPTIVE 
POD1000000025_S0000120	AND WE MAYBE CAN MAKE THIS MOVIE AND MAYBE THERE'S LIKE DIFFERENT MUSIC OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THERE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOT GONNA HAPPEN HERE 
POD1000000025_S0000121	AND THEN SUDDENLY WE LIKE PACKED UP FROM THE WEST OAKLAND PLACE AND MOVED TO L A

POD1000000025_S0000131	HAMILTON WAS SUCH AN INTERESTING LIKE MUST LIKE IT WAS A PLAY IT WAS LIKE LEGIT WRITTEN FOR HIM TO FLEX ALL THE THINGS HE'S GOOD AT 
POD1000000025_S0000132	THEY WERE LIKE WHO'S THIS LIKE RAP KID THAT LIKE TURNS OUT CAN ALSO ACT

POD1000000027_S0000011	IT'S ABOUT A SCANDAL THAT ROCKED N B A AND TELLS US A LOT ABOUT HOW POWER RACE AND CELEBRITY INTERSECT IN MODERN SPORTS 
POD1000000027_S0000013	FOR THIS SEASON WE'RE EXCITED TO WORK WITH E S P N RAMONA SHELBURNE ONE OF OUR TOP N B A REPORTERS AND L A NEEDED AND SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN COVERING THE STORY FROM THE MOMENT IT BROKE 
POD1000000027_S0000014	RAMONA IS YOUR HOST FOR ALL FIVE EPISODES THE QUICK ORDER OF WARNING THIS SEASON CONTAINS MATURE SUBJECT MATTER AND LANGUAGE AND NOW COMING UP BACK THE BREAK FROM THIRTY FOR THIRTY AND UNDEFEATED THE STIRRING UP FEARS 
POD1000000027_S0000016	SHELLY STERLING THOUGHT SHE WAS JUST GONNA RETURN SOME CLOTHES TO NEIMAN MARCUS WHEN SHE GOT IN HER MERCEDES BENZ STATION WAGON AND MADE THE DRIVE FROM MALIBU TO BEVERLY HILLS IT WAS EARLY IN THE SPRING OF TWO THOUSANDS AND FOURTEEN 
POD1000000027_S0000017	AND EVEN THOUGH SHELLY WAS ALMOST EIGHTY YEARS OLD SHE WAS STILL GOING INTO TOWN AS RICH PEOPLE CALL BEVERLY HILLS FOUR OR FIVE DAYS A WEEK IT'S HARD TO GUESS SHELLY'S AGE IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT 
POD1000000027_S0000018	BECAUSE SHE KEEPS HER HAIR A CONVINCING PALE BLONDE AND HER FACE IS VERY WELL-MAINTAINED DRIVING INTO BEVERLY HILLS IS BASICALLY LIKE ENTERING A STATE PARK FOR THE RICH AND FAMOUS 
POD1000000027_S0000019	THERE ARE THE ICONIC BROWN AND YELLOW SIGNS THAT LET YOU KNOW YOU HAVE ENTERED A SPECIAL PLACE AND SHELLY STERLING AND HER HUSBAND DONALD OWNED A TON OF IT 
POD1000000027_S0000020	OVER THEIR SIXTY YEAR MARRIAGE THE STERLINGS BUILT A REAL ESTATE EMPIRE IN THEIR HEYDAY THEY WERE THE LARGEST RESIDENTIAL LANDLORDS IN L A COUNTY 
POD1000000027_S0000022	BUT MOST PEOPLE KNEW HER HUSBAND DONALD STERLING AS THE LONG TIME OWNER OF THE LOS ANGELES CLIPPERS ONE OF THE WORST OWNERS IN ALL OF SPORTS HIS TEAM WAS THE LAUGHINGSTOCK OF THE N B A FOR DECADES 
POD1000000027_S0000023	FOR SHELLY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST A JAUNT DOWN RODEO DRIVE TO RETURN SOME WILDLY EXPENSIVE CLOTHES BUT UNBEKNOWNST TO HER HER HUSBAND WAS ALSO AT NEIMAN MARCUS THAT DAY 
POD1000000027_S0000024	WITH A WOMAN FORTY-NINE YEARS HIS JUNIOR NAMED V STIVIANO SHE WASN'T THE FIRST MISTRESS NOT EVEN CLOSE BUT V WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
POD1000000027_S0000026	SHELLY TOLD ME THAT STORY WHEN WE MET IN THE WINTER OF TWO THOUSAND AND NINETEEN AT THE BEVERLY HILLS PLAZA HOTEL OR MY HOTEL AS SHE CALLS IT 
POD1000000027_S0000027	SHELLY WAS EIGHTY-FOUR AT THE TIME BUT SHE CAN TELL THAT STORY OF THAT RUN-IN WITH DONALD AND V FIVE YEARS EARLIER WITH EXACTING DETAIL 
POD1000000027_S0000028	I HAPPENED TO BE THERE TO RETURN SOMETHING AND SHE WAS THERE WITH DONALD AND WITH SOME OTHER FRIENDS AND WE HAD A BIG CONFRONTATION SHE WAS VERY VERY VERY NASTY AND MEAN TO ME 
POD1000000027_S0000029	WHAT HAPPENED WAS THAT SHE RAN INTO SHELLY I THINK AT NORDSTROM AND THEY STARTED TALKING AND I GUESS THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND 
POD1000000027_S0000030	THAT'S V STIVIANO'S LAWYER MAC NEHORAY AND WHEN I TOLD SHELLY STERLING HIS VERSION OF THE STORY SHE SCOFFED 
POD1000000027_S0000031	IT WAS AT NEIMAN MARCUS 
POD1000000027_S0000032	AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS FUNNY THAT SHELLY TOOK THE TIME TO CORRECT HIM I MEAN HERE IS A WOMAN TALKING TO A FEMALE REPORTER ABOUT HER HUSBAND'S INFIDELITY WHO CARES WHETHER YOU CONFRONT YOUR HUSBAND'S MISTRESS OUTSIDE OF NEIMAN MARCUS OR NORDYS 
POD1000000027_S0000033	BUT THE DETAILS MATTER HERE IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT BECAUSE THAT MEETING OUTSIDE NEIMAN MARCUS THAT PETTY SQUABBLE BETWEEN A WIFE AND HER HUSBAND'S MISTRESS SET OFF A CHAIN OF EVENTS 
POD1000000027_S0000034	THAT IN THE END LED TO ONE OF THE BIGGEST SCANDALS IN PROFESSIONAL SPORTS A CONTROVERSY THAT FORCED THE N B A TO FINALLY DEAL WITH DONALD STERLING AFTER DECADES OF HIS BAD BEHAVIOR AND HAD RIPPLE EFFECTS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LEAGUE 
POD1000000027_S0000036	THIS IS THE STERLING AFFAIRS FROM THIRTY FOR THIRTY PODCASTS AND THE UNDEFEATED I'M RAMONA SHELBURNE 
POD1000000027_S0000039	I'VE COVERED BASKETBALL IN L A FOR A LONG TIME THE N B A IS A LEAGUE OF HUGE PERSONALITIES AND EVEN BIGGER EGOS FIGHTING FOR POWER AND IF YOU WANT THE REAL SCORE THAT'S THE GAME YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW 
POD1000000027_S0000041	I LEARNED PRETTY QUICKLY THAT THERE'S NO OTHER OWNER IN BASKETBALL WITH QUITE THE SAME PERSONALITY OR EGO OF DONALD STERLING STERLING WASN'T A BASKETBALL GUY HE WAS A PERSONAL INJURY LAWYER AND THEN HE GOT FILTHY RICH OFF OF REAL ESTATE 
POD1000000027_S0000043	THAT'S WHAT HE WAS REALLY GOOD AT 
POD1000000027_S0000045	I COULD NEVER UNDERSTAND WHY HE EVEN KEPT THE CLIPPERS WHEN HIS REPUTATION AS AN OWNER WAS SO BAD BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I ALWAYS ASSUMED THAT DEEP DOWN HE WANTED WHAT EVERYONE IN THE GAME IS SUPPOSED TO WANT TO WIN 
POD1000000027_S0000047	BUT RICH PEOPLE LIKE DONALD STERLING MULTI BILLION DOLLAR RICH PEOPLE DON'T LIVE IN THE SAME WORLD AS THE REST OF US DON'T PLAY BY THE SAME RULES WHEN YOU HAVE ENOUGH MONEY IT'S LIKE YOU'RE RUBBER EVERYTHING JUST BOUNCES OFF OF YOU 
POD1000000027_S0000048	EVEN THREE DECADES OF DRIVING AN N B A FRANCHISE INTO THE GROUND WHEN YOU'RE AS RICH AS DONALD AND SHELLY YOU GET TO TELL YOURSELF THAT EVERYTHING IS FABULOUS

POD1000000027_S0000060	AND DONALD STERLING'S LIFE WAS FABULOUS WHY WOULD HE THINK OTHERWISE NOBODY EVER QUESTIONED HIM TO HIS FACE ANYWAY HE DID WHATEVER HE WANTED HE SAID WHATEVER HE WANTED HE HAD RELATIONSHIPS WITH WHOMEVER HE WANTED 
POD1000000027_S0000062	I DIDN'T KNOW V STIVIANO BACK THEN AND YES THAT'S HER REAL NAME V JUST THE LETTER V WITH A PERIOD SHE WAS BORN MARIA VANESSA PEREZ

POD1000000027_S0000067	MONEY AND HERMES BAGS ARE GIFTS AND NEVER EVER HUMILIATE THE WIFE BUT V STIVIANO EITHER DIDN'T KNOW OR DIDN'T CARE BECAUSE SHE BROKE EVERY LAST RULE IN THE MISTRESS TERMS AND AGREEMENTS

POD1000000027_S0000077	NOBODY LIKED HER WE KNEW WHY SHE WAS HERE AND WE ALL THOUGHT IT WAS CRAZY TO BEGIN WITH BUT YOU KNOW IT WASN'T OUR PLACE TO SPEAK ON IT AT THE TIME 
POD1000000027_S0000078	CLIPPERS EMPLOYEES OFTEN GOT CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS BIZARRE TRIANGLE SHELLY WOULD CALL TEAM PRESIDENT ANDY ROESER DEMANDING THAT V NOT BE ALLOWED IN THE BUILDING AND THEN DONALD WOULD CALL ROESER AND ASK HIM TO LEAVE FOUR TICKETS FOR HER

POD1000000027_S0000085	THE FIGHT WITH SHELLY STARTED WHEN HE HUNG UP 
POD1000000027_S0000086	NOT THAT THAT WAS UNCOMMON EVEN WITHOUT V THEY FOUGHT OFTEN BUT THIS WAS ESCALATING SHELLY AND DONALD'S YOUNGEST SON SCOTT HAD TO STEP IN BEFORE IT GOT PHYSICAL HE CONFRONTED HIS FATHER AND DEMANDED HE STOP THIS NONSENSE WITH V 
POD1000000027_S0000087	AND STOPPED DISRESPECTING HIS MOTHER LIKE THIS 
POD1000000027_S0000089	IT WAS A BIG MOMENT BUT NOTHING CAME OF IT 
POD1000000027_S0000091	A WEEK LATER SCOTT DIED 
POD1000000027_S0000093	IT WAS FIRST REPORTED TO BE A PULMONARY EMBOLISM BUT LATER REVEALED TO BE AN OVERDOSE HE WAS THIRTY-TWO 
POD1000000027_S0000095	AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE REALIZE THIS BUT YOU LOST A CHILD 
POD1000000027_S0000096	I KNOW 
POD1000000027_S0000097	RIGHT AROUND THEN 
POD1000000027_S0000098	JANUARY FIRST 
POD1000000027_S0000100	SHELLY WAS DEVASTATED 
POD1000000027_S0000101	I WAS GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS OF LIVING 
POD1000000027_S0000103	IT WASN'T JUST THAT THE FIGHT WITH V WAS A LAST VOLATILE MOMENT BETWEEN DONALD AND SCOTT 
POD1000000027_S0000105	WHEN SCOTT DIED DONALD STAYED WITH V INSTEAD OF GOING HOME TO HIS WIFE AS SHE GRIEVED IT WAS TOO MUCH SHE KICKED DON OUT OF THE HOUSE 
POD1000000027_S0000107	SHELLY NEEDED BREATHING ROOM AND I THINK DON HAD PUSHED THE ENVELOPE A LITTLE TOO FAR 
POD1000000027_S0000108	I REALLY THOUGHT THAT WE PROBABLY WERE GONNA BE GETTING A DIVORCE 
POD1000000027_S0000110	BUT SHELLY AND DONALD HAD BEEN TOGETHER TOO LONG BEEN THROUGH TOO MUCH TOGETHER HAD TOO MUCH OF THEIR LIVES AND THEIR MONEY INTERTWINED 
POD1000000027_S0000112	THEY DID NOT DIVORCE THE SITUATION SIMPLY CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE OVER THE NEXT YEAR AS DONALD SPENT MORE AND MORE TIME WITH V 
POD1000000027_S0000114	PLUS SHELLY WAS STARTING TO LEARN ABOUT THE GIFTS V POSTED PICTURES ON INSTAGRAM V DRIVING THE TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS RED FERRARI THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT HER 
POD1000000027_S0000115	AND THE RANGE ROVER AND THE TWO BENTLEYS SHELLY ALSO FOUND OUT THAT DONALD HAD BOUGHT V A ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLAR DUPLEX 
POD1000000027_S0000116	WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD PAID FOR ALL THE CARS AND HE PAID FOR THIS HOUSE I WAS FURIOUS 
POD1000000027_S0000117	IT WAS THAT ANGER SHELLY BROUGHT TO NEIMAN MARCUS WITH HER RETURNS ON THE FATEFUL DAY SHE THAT SHE ENCOUNTERED DONALD AND V IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME THE TWO WOMEN HAD RUN INTO EACH OTHER OR ARGUED BUT THIS TIME SHELLY DECIDED SHE'D HAD ENOUGH 
POD1000000027_S0000118	AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED I WAS GONNA SUE HER 
POD1000000027_S0000119	ON MARCH SEVEN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN SHELLY STERLING FILED A LAWSUIT IN CALIFORNIA SUPERIOR COURT AGAINST V STIVIANO SEEKING THE RETURN OF ALL THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD 
POD1000000027_S0000121	DONALD AND SHELLY STERLING WERE WORTH MULTIPLE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAD DONE WHAT THE ULTRA RICH DO PUT ALL THEIR MONEY AND PROPERTY INTO A JOINT TRUST 
POD1000000027_S0000122	EVERY DIME THE STERLINGS SPENT COST EACH OF A THEM A NICKEL THEREFORE SHELLY ARGUED THE MONEY THAT DONALD USED TO PAY FOR THE GIFTS WAS JUST AS MUCH HERS AS IT WAS HIS 
POD1000000027_S0000123	SO SHE TURNED TO THE COURTS THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE EXTREME WELL YOU DON'T KNOW THE STERLINGS CALLING A LAWYER IS HOW THEY GET OUT OF BED IN THE MORNING 
POD1000000027_S0000124	TO SAY THEY'RE LITIGIOUS IS LIKE SAYING THERE'S TRAFFIC ON THE FOUR OR FIVE AND BESIDES SUING TO GET WHAT THEY WANT HAD PROVEN INCREDIBLY EFFECTIVE FOR THE STERLINGS OVER THE YEARS 
POD1000000027_S0000125	MOST PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE MEANS OR THE STOMACH TO BATTLE THEM IN COURT THEY'D SETTLE BEFORE THEY STARVED 
POD1000000027_S0000126	SHE KEPT SAYING TO DONALD YOU BETTER HAVE HER DROP THE LAWSUIT AND HE'D SAY OH SHE WON'T REALLY GO THROUGH WITH IT BUT SHE'S JUST DOING IT FOR EFFECT AND SHE SAYS WELL SHE BETTER DROP THE LAWSUIT 
POD1000000027_S0000127	BUT HERE'S HOW THE LAWSUIT THE COURTROOM PRODUCT OF A BEDROOM DISPUTE REALLY CAME TO CHANGE EVERYTHING FOR SOME TIME NOW V HAD BEEN RECORDING HER CONVERSATIONS WITH DONALD 
POD1000000027_S0000128	SWEETIE I'M SORRY 
POD1000000027_S0000129	I'M SO SORRY TOO WE MADE A GIANT MISTAKE BOTH OF US 
POD1000000027_S0000130	AND ACCORDING TO V AND HER LAWYER DONALD WAS AWARE SHE WAS MAKING THE TAPES 
POD1000000027_S0000132	HE'D BEEN FORGETTING THINGS HE SAID TO HER AND THE TAPES WERE A WAY OF REMINDING HIM 
POD1000000027_S0000134	PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE PLEASE PLEASE 
POD1000000027_S0000135	SHE'D RECORDED HUNDREDS OF CONVERSATIONS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS A LOT OF THE RECORDINGS WERE MUNDANE BORING EVEN BUT SOME OF THE RECORDINGS WERE ARGUMENTS AND CAPTURED A SIDE OF DONALD THAT HE WOULD NEVER WANT HIS WIFE OR ANYONE ELSE TO HEAR 
POD1000000027_S0000136	I GUESS THAT YOU DON'T KNOW THAT MAYBE YOU'RE STUPID 
POD1000000027_S0000137	NO MATTER WHAT THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF THOSE TAPES WAS THEY BECAME SOMETHING V COULD USE AS BLACKMAIL BECAUSE V STIVIANO HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING THOSE GIFTS FROM DONALD 
POD1000000027_S0000138	SHE WANTED ME TO DROP THE LAWSUIT 
POD1000000027_S0000139	V SAYS TO DONALD I WANT THAT BITCH WIFE OF YOURS LAWSUIT DISMISSED 
POD1000000027_S0000140	PIERCE O'DONNELL IS SHELLY STERLING'S LAWYER 
POD1000000027_S0000141	AND HE TRIED TO GET SHELLY TO DISMISS IT AND SHE WOULDN'T DO IT 
POD1000000027_S0000142	IF DONALD COULDN'T OR WOULDN'T FIX THE SITUATION V DECIDED SHE WOULD TAKE MATTERS INTO HER OWN HANDS IT WAS TIME TO USE THE TAPES

POD1000000027_S0000170	ATTACHED TO THE TEXT WAS AN AUDIO FILE AND WHEN THE CLIPPERS EMPLOYEE OPENED THE FILE SHE HEARD THIS 
POD1000000027_S0000171	IN YOUR LOUSY INSTAGRAM YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE YOURSELF WITH WALKING WITH BLACK PEOPLE 
POD1000000027_S0000172	AND IT BOTHERS YOU 
POD1000000027_S0000173	YEAH IT BOTHERS ME A LOT THAT YOU WANT TO PROMOTE BROADCAST THAT YOU'RE ASSOCIATING WITH BLACK PEOPLE DO YOU HAVE TO

POD1000000027_S0000176	I'M A MIXED GIRL 
POD1000000027_S0000178	IT WAS SHOCKING THE CLIPPERS ASSISTANT IMMEDIATELY EMAILED THE FILE TO CLIPPERS PRESIDENT ANDY ROESER AND THAT'S HOW SHELLY LEARNED ABOUT THE TAPE TOO 
POD1000000027_S0000179	I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THAT THE TAPE WAS SENT TO THE CLIPPERS UNTIL SOMEBODY AT A GAME TOLD ME THAT THEY SAID THEY RECEIVED A TAPE FROM HER 
POD1000000027_S0000180	AND I SAID WELL WHAT IS THE TAPE ABOUT SO I SAID TO ANDY ANDY ROESER I SAID ANDY WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT THIS AND HE SAYS OH WELL SHE'LL NEVER DO ANYTHING 
POD1000000027_S0000181	ROESER HAD WORKED FOR DONALD STERLING FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES HE DID WHAT EVERYBODY LEARNS TO DO AFTER A WHILE STAY OUT OF THE REALLY UGLY STUFF 
POD1000000027_S0000182	DONALD AND SHELLY HAD CLEANED UP THEIR OWN MESSES FOR SIX DECADES HE FIGURED THEY'D EVENTUALLY MAKE THIS ONE GO AWAY TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T SHELLY TOLD HER LAWYERS ABOUT THE TAPES 
POD1000000027_S0000183	AND THEY IN TURN WENT TO V'S LAWYER AND DEMANDED TO HEAR THEM AND THAT'S WHEN V STIVIANO MADE HER BIG MOVE 
POD1000000027_S0000185	I GOT A CALL BY A TRUSTED CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE WHO SAID YOU HAVE TO HEAR THIS 
POD1000000027_S0000186	MIKE WALTERS WAS THE NEWS DIRECTOR AT T M Z AT THE TIME NOW HE RUNS HIS OWN CELEBRITY NEWS SITE THE BLAST 
POD1000000027_S0000187	THE FIRST THING I DID WAS SAY WHO'S DONALD STERLING I HAD HEARD THE NAME I KNEW THAT DONALD STERLING WAS IMPORTANT BUT I HAD NO IDEA THAT HE OWNED THE CLIPPERS 
POD1000000027_S0000188	EVEN FOR SOMEONE FROM T M Z WHOSE JOB WAS BREAKING THE INTERNET WITH THE JUICIEST MOST CONTROVERSIAL STORIES THIS FELT LIKE SOMETHING DIFFERENT 
POD1000000027_S0000190	I RECEIVED THE AUDIO AND SAID OH MY GOD 
POD1000000027_S0000193	IT WAS THE MOST REPULSIVE DISGUSTING 
POD1000000027_S0000195	UNBELIEVABLE 
POD1000000027_S0000197	AUDIO OR MOMENT THAT I'D EVER HEARD IN MY LIFETIME COME OUT OF SOMEBODY'S MOUTH THAT THEN ONCE I REALIZED WHO THEY WERE HOW MUCH IMPACT THAT MAY HAVE 
POD1000000027_S0000199	BUT NO ONE IN CLIPPERS WORLD SEEMED TO REALIZE 
POD1000000027_S0000201	THE FACT IS SHELLY AND SEVERAL PEOPLE IN THE CLIPPERS ORGANIZATION HEARD THE RECORDING AND DECIDED NOT TO ACT ON IT OR WEREN'T APPALLED ENOUGH TO ACT ON IT MAYBE THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW BIG A SPLASH THIS TAPE COULD MAKE 
POD1000000027_S0000203	I THINK THIS DEALS WITH VERY TOUCHY SUBJECTS LIKE RACISM SEXISM 
POD1000000027_S0000205	THINGS THAT TOUCH EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY SO I KNEW WITH ALL OF THAT COMBINED WITH THE FACT THAT IT ACTUALLY WAS ON TAPE 
POD1000000027_S0000207	AND IF I COULD DO MY JOB PROPERLY EVERYONE WAS GONNA HEAR IT THAT THIS WOULD BE A GIGANTIC THING 
POD1000000027_S0000209	SO MIKE WALTERS CALLED UP THE N B A THEIR NEW COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER HAD BARELY BEEN IN OFFICE FOR THREE MONTHS 
POD1000000027_S0000210	I ACTUALLY HAD NEVER HEARD OF ADAM SILVER UNTIL THAT DAY 
POD1000000027_S0000212	TURNS OUT NOT EVEN T M Z WAS GONNA RELEASE SOMETHING LIKE THIS WITHOUT SOME DUE DILIGENCE 
POD1000000027_S0000214	THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN PRIVACY OF PEOPLE AND THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST IN WHAT IS SAID IN THIS AUDIO AND I THINK EVERYONE WILL AGREE WITH ME WHEN I SAY THIS 
POD1000000027_S0000215	THIS HAD TO BE HEARD PERIOD 
POD1000000027_S0000217	AFTER CALLING THE LEAGUE T M Z CALLED THE CLIPPERS TO LET THEM KNOW THEY WERE ABOUT TO PUBLISH A TAPE THAT WOULD BE VERY DAMAGING TO DONALD STERLING 
POD1000000027_S0000218	IF YOU'RE DONALD STERLING THERE'S NEVER A GOOD TIME TO HAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND OUT YOU AS A RACIST IF YOU'RE THE CLIPPERS THIS COULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED AT A WORSE MOMENT DONALD STERLING'S CLIPPERS HAD BEEN A LAUGHING STOCK FOR DECADES 
POD1000000027_S0000220	BECAUSE HONESTLY LIKE THESE CLIPPERS JOKES IS SOMETHING WE THEY'RE NOT EVEN JOKES THEY'RE STATEMENTS OF FACT 
POD1000000027_S0000222	IN THE THIRTY SOME ODD YEARS HE HAD OWNED THE TEAM THEY'D ONLY MADE THE PLAYOFFS SIX TIMES THEY'D NEVER EVEN MOVED PAST THE SEMIFINALS THAT HAD ALL STARTED TO CHANGE IN THE LATE TWO THOUSANDS THOUGHT THE TEAM HAD DRAFTED A STAR BLAKE GRIFFIN

POD1000000027_S0000266	I FILED MY GAME STORY AND TRIED TO START WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND THIS ONE 
POD1000000027_S0000268	LIKE T M Z'S MIKE WALTERS AS SOON AS I HEARD THAT TAPE I KNEW THIS WAS GOING TO BE HUGE 
POD1000000027_S0000269	THE DISGRACED CLIPPERS OWNER IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
POD1000000027_S0000270	STERLING HAS A LONG HISTORY OF QUESTIONABLE BEHAVIOR 
POD1000000027_S0000272	IT'S OBVIOUSLY APPALLING IT'S VERY DISTURBING BUT UM TO BE QUITE HONEST WITH YOU I WASN'T TOO SURPRISED 
POD1000000027_S0000273	WITHIN HOURS THE AUDIO OF DONALD STERLING MAKING RACIST REMARKS TO V STIVIANO HAD GONE VIRAL 
POD1000000027_S0000275	T M Z'S CAMERAMEN AND REPORTERS SWARMED THE LOBBY OF THE CLIPPERS TEAM HOTEL THEY HAD BOOKED SEVERAL ROOMS AT THE FOUR SEASONS IN ADVANCE SO THEY COULD LEGALLY BE INSIDE THE PRIVATE PROPERTY 
POD1000000027_S0000276	OUTSIDE THE HOTEL WAS EVEN MORE CHAOTIC THE WHOLE WORLD WANTED A REACTION CLIPPERS TEAM SECURITY ADVISED PLAYERS AND STAFFERS TO STAY INSIDE THEIR HOTEL ROOMS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THEY WERE ON LOCKDOWN 
POD1000000027_S0000277	WHEN IT CAME OUT I REMEMBER IT JUST BEING CHAOS IT JUST FROM THEN ON IT WAS JUST AH THAT'S ALL ANYBODY WAS TALKING ABOUT 
POD1000000027_S0000278	BY MORNING LEBRON JAMES THE BIGGEST STAR IN THE LEAGUE WAS SAYING THERE WAS NO ROOM FOR A PERSON LIKE DONALD STERLING IN THE N B A 
POD1000000027_S0000280	AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY ADAM SILVER WAS FACING HIS FIRST REAL CRISIS 
POD1000000027_S0000281	N B A COMMISSIONER ADAM SILVER SITTING DOWN IN MEMPHIS ADDRESSING THE COMMENTS MADE BY DONALD STERLING 
POD1000000027_S0000282	THE AUDIO RECORDING POSTED BY T M Z IS TRULY OFFENSIVE AND DISTURBING AND WE INTEND TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE 
POD1000000027_S0000283	SILVER LAUNCHED AN INVESTIGATION WITHIN HOURS 
POD1000000027_S0000284	I'M NOT YET PREPARED TO DISCUSS ANY POTENTIAL SANCTIONS AGAINST DONALD STERLING WE WILL HOWEVER MOVE EXTRAORDINARILY QUICKLY IN OUR INVESTIGATION 
POD1000000027_S0000286	IF IT WAS STERLING ON THOSE TAPES IF THEY HADN'T BEEN DOCTORED OR ALTERED SILVER KNEW HE WANTED TO PUNISH HIM SEVERELY THE LEAGUE WAS OUTRAGED 
POD1000000027_S0000287	BECAUSE ON TOP OF DONALD STERLING SAYING ALL THESE UNFORGIVABLY RACIST THINGS STERLING WAS ALSO TAKING SHOTS AT ONE OF THE MOST BELOVED FIGURES IN ALL OF BASKETBALL MAGIC JOHNSON 
POD1000000027_S0000289	IT WAS AS SHOCKING AND AS BIZARRE ANYTHING ON THE TAPE THAT A PICTURE OF V STIVIANO AND MAGIC JOHNSON HAD SET HIM OFF TO HEAR DONALD STERLING TALK THAT WAY ABOUT MAGIC 
POD1000000027_S0000290	THE GUY WHO'D TURNED THE LAKERS INTO A DYNASTY WHO'D FOUGHT OFF H I V THAT'S THE GUY DONALD STERLING TOLD HIS MISTRESS WASN'T WELCOME AT HIS GAMES 
POD1000000027_S0000291	PLAIN AND SIMPLE WHEN YOU HEARD THOSE COMMENTS MAGIC WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION

POD1000000027_S0000293	AND PLAYING FOR HIM AND COACHING FOR HIM THIS IS THIS IS BAD FOR EVERYBODY IT'S BAD FOR AMERICA AND SO I'M REALLY UPSET ABOUT IT 
POD1000000027_S0000294	EVEN THE FAMOUSLY APOLITICAL MICHAEL JORDAN VOICED HIS OUTRAGE 
POD1000000027_S0000295	MICHAEL JORDAN WEIGHED IN THERE IS NO ROOM IN THE N B A OR ANYWHERE ELSE FOR THE KIND OF RACISM AND HATRED THAT MR STERLING ALLEGEDLY EXPRESSED WE CANNOT TOLERATE MUST NOT TOLERATE DISCRIMINATION AT ANY LEVEL

POD1000000027_S0000309	THE TAPES DOMINATED THE NEWS CYCLE NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY WERE JUICY BUT BECAUSE DONALD STERLING WAS ARTICULATING SOMETHING DEEPER MORE SHAMEFUL 
POD1000000027_S0000311	A PLANTATION MENTALITY THAT'S AT THE HEART OF A LOT OF THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY 
POD1000000027_S0000313	THAT'S AN N B A OWNER A MAN WORTH BILLIONS OF DOLLARS GOING ON FOR MORE THAN NINE MINUTES SPEWING THE MOST VILE OF RACIST THOUGHTS A WHITE OWNER WHOSE TWENTYMAN ROSTER WAS STACKED WITH A MAJORITY OF AFRICAN AMERICAN PLAYERS 
POD1000000027_S0000314	INCLUDING RYAN HOLLINS

POD1000000027_S0000317	EARTHQUAKES BOTH REAL AND METAPHORICAL HAPPENED SUDDENLY BUT THEY ARE ANYTHING BUT SUDDEN THE TREMOR IS A PRODUCT OF TENSIONS THAT BUILD UP FOR YEARS UNTIL THE FAULT LINES SIMPLY BREAK 
POD1000000027_S0000318	LOS ANGELES SITS ON TWO FAULT LINES THE SAN ANDREAS AND RACE ALL OF US KNOW IT WE LIVE WITH IT DONALD STERLING WAS ANOTHER 
POD1000000027_S0000319	ANYONE WHO PLAYED FOR HIM OR WORKED FOR HIM OR COVERED HIM IN THE PRESS OR LIVED IN ONE OF HIS HUNDREDS OF APARTMENTS ON THE ONE HAND KNEW THAT IT WAS ALL A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL HE BLEW UP THE UNDERLYING ISSUES WITH STERLING WERE WELL KNOWN AND WELL DOCUMENTED 
POD1000000027_S0000320	BUT LIKE MOST INSANELY WEALTHY WHITE MEN IN AMERICA DONALD HAD MANAGED TO WIGGLE BULLY AND FIGHT HIS WAY OUT OF ALL HE KNEW HOW TO PLAY HIS LEVERAGE AND POWER OUTLAST HIS ADVERSARIES AND WIN YOU CAN CALL IT THAT 
POD1000000027_S0000321	BUT THIS TIME FELT DIFFERENT 
POD1000000027_S0000323	I REMEMBER I HAD SAID AH THIS IS REALLY BAD REALLY BAD AND I I KNEW SOMETHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE SHOCK 
POD1000000027_S0000325	THAT'S WHAT WE ALL WERE SHOCKED BUT WE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN SURPRISED 
POD1000000029_S0000001	FACEBOOK'S HAD FIFTEEN MONTHS OF QUOTE FRESH HELL BUT TWO POINT ONE BILLION STILL USE IT OR INSTAGRAM OR WHATSAPP MESSENGER EVERYDAY 
POD1000000029_S0000002	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AND JACK STEWARD INFORMALLY WOOD 
POD1000000029_S0000004	DESPITE THE PRIVACY SCANDALS THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS AND THE ACCUSATIONS OF DESTROYING DEMOCRACY THIS WEEK FACEBOOK REPORTED ITS ADVERTISING REVENUE AND GLOBAL USERS ARE GROWING 
POD1000000029_S0000005	IN THIS WEEK'S QUALITY ASSURANCE WE TAKE A DEEPER DIVE INTO WHY IN ITS EARLY YEARS FACEBOOK PRIORITIZED GROWTH OVER EVERYTHING ELSE 
POD1000000029_S0000006	NEARLY EVERY CRISIS FACEBOOK NOW FACES STEMS FROM THAT NICHOLAS THOMPSON EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF WIRED SAYS THAT'S LEFT MANAGEMENT'S NAVIGATE METAPHORICAL MIND FIELD 
POD1000000029_S0000007	THERE WAS A LOT OF UNEXPLODED ORDINANCE THAT THEY WERE INEVITABLY GOING TO STEP ON IT SOME POINT 
POD1000000029_S0000008	HE'S AN AUTHOR ON THE MAGAZINE'S LATEST COVER STORY WHICH GOES BEHIND THE SCENES OF THE TROUBLED COMPANY HE SAYS FACEBOOK'S BUSINESS IS ACTUALLY SOLID FOR COUPLE OF REASONS 
POD1000000029_S0000009	NUMBER ONE THE ADVERTISING BUSINESS MODEL THEY CAME UP WITH IS ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER AND IT DOESN'T REQUIRE LOTS OF CHANGES THEY JUST BUILT AN AMAZING BUSINESS MODEL AND THE MARGINAL COSTS OF BRINGING IN NEW ADVERTISERS ARE VERY LOW 
POD1000000029_S0000010	SECONDLY ONE OF THE SMARTEST BUSINESS DECISIONS THAT MARK ZUCKERBERG EVER MADE WAS TO BUY INSTAGRAM AND PEOPLE DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT INSTAGRAM IS OWNED BY FACEBOOK OR IF THEY DISTRUST FACEBOOK THEY DON'T DISTRUST INSTAGRAM SO INSTAGRAM CONTINUES TO GROW 
POD1000000029_S0000011	SO THEY MAKE LOTS OF MONEY OFF OF CORE FACEBOOK THEY HAVE LOTS OF USER GROWTH ON INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP AND THE BUSINESS IS DOING GREAT 
POD1000000029_S0000012	YOU WOULD THINK AT SOME POINT THAT MAYBE ADVERTISERS WOULD START TO PUSH BACK I MEAN IF FACEBOOK'S REPUTATION HAS REALLY TAKEN THIS REALLY HUGE DENT THAT IT APPEARS IT HAS WHY DO PEOPLE STILL WANT TO ADVERTISE WITH IT 
POD1000000029_S0000013	WELL BECAUSE THE ADVERTISING CONTINUES TO WORK IF AT SOME POINTS PEOPLE HAVE AN ICKY FEELING WHEN THEY USE FACEBOOK AND THEREFORE THE ADS ARE LESS EFFECTIVE THEN ADVERTISERS WILL LEAVE 
POD1000000029_S0000014	BUT AT THIS MOMENT FACEBOOK ALLOWS YOU TO VERY SPECIFICALLY TARGET SPECIFIC USERS IN WAYS THAT YOU CANNOT ON OTHER PLATFORMS AND FOR LOTS OF ADVERTISERS THAT'S JUST A DEAL THAT'S TOO GOOD TO PASS UP 
POD1000000029_S0000015	NOW FACEBOOK IS ANTICIPATING ONCE UP TO A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WE HEARD THAT FROM THIS WEEK ABOUT HOW IT'S HANDLED SOME OF THESE PRIVACY ISSUES 
POD1000000029_S0000016	WILL THEY EVEN FEEL THAT IS THE QUESTION THEY HAVE SO MUCH CASH ON HAND IS IS IT A BIG DEAL 
POD1000000029_S0000017	NO SO FACEBOOK PUT OUT IN THEIR EARNINGS CALL THEY SAID THEY ANTICIPATE A THREE TO FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE ARE THE NUMBERS THE F T C HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT WITH THEM OR IF FACEBOOK IS JUST TRYING TO SET EXPECTATIONS AS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC 
POD1000000029_S0000018	I WOULD NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT FACEBOOK IS HIT WITH A TEN BILLION DOLLAR FINE OR A TWENTY BILLION DOLLAR FINE REGARDLESS TO YOUR QUESTION EVEN IF IT IS AT THE HIGHER END WHETHER IT'S FIVE OR TEN OR TWENTY IT'S TINY 
POD1000000029_S0000019	THEIR MARKET CAP IS UP I BELIEVE FORTY BILLION DOLLARS AS WE TALK THIS MORNING SO IT'S NOT A HUGE HIT TO THEM OBVIOUSLY THEY WOULD RATHER HAVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS THAN NOT HAVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS BUT THEY WILL BE FINE REGARDLESS OF WHAT THIS NUMBER COMES OUT AT 
POD1000000029_S0000020	THE THING THEY REALLY WORRY ABOUT IS ANTITRUST IF THERE IS ANTITRUST REGULATION AND IT COMES DOWN HARD ON THEM THAT IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM AND THAT WOULD MAKE THE MARKET DROP DRAMATICALLY 
POD1000000029_S0000021	WHAT ARE THE STAKES FOR FACEBOOK'S LEADERSHIP AROUND ALL OF THESE SCANDALS THAT THE FAKE NEWS THE OFFENSIVE CONTENT THE PRIVACY YOU YOU KNOW YOU DETAIL THAT THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY THOUSAND MODERATORS NOW AH DOES THAT MEAN THEY'RE ACTUALLY TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK 
POD1000000029_S0000022	YES ABSOLUTELY FACEBOOK IS TAKING IT VERY SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK SO THERE ARE TWO REALLY INTERESTING QUESTIONS UM IN THERE SO NUMBER ONE IS DO THEY TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS A BUSINESS RISK ABSOLUTELY ARE THEY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO COUNTER FAKE NEWS AND ALL OF THE MANIPULATION ON THE PLATFORM 
POD1000000029_S0000023	ABSOLUTELY WHAT ARE THE STAKES TO THEIR BUSINESS THEY ARE A VERY HIGH IF SCANDAL CONTINUES TO MULTIPLY THERE COULD BE REAL CONSEQUENCES DOWN THE ROAD WHAT ARE THE STAKES SPECIFICALLY TO TOP MANAGEMENT MEANING MARK ZUCKERBERG AND SHERYL SANDBERG TWO PEOPLE WHO WE MOST ASSOCIATE WITH THE COMPANY 
POD1000000029_S0000024	FOR ZUCKERBERG HE'S GOING TO RUN THE COMPANY AS LONG AS HE WANTS TO HE HAS VOTING CONTROL OF THE SHARES HE'S APPOINTED HIS FRIENDS AS BOARD MEMBERS HE IS IN A GOOD POSITION 
POD1000000029_S0000025	WHENEVER HE WANTS TO GO AND RUN THE CHAN ZUCKERBERG INITIATIVE OR JUST GO BE AN INTELLECTUAL THOUGHT LEADER OR DO BILL GATES TYPE THINGS HE WILL GO CHOOSE TO DO THAT FOR SANDBERG IT'S TOUGHER 
POD1000000029_S0000026	AND THERE WERE MOMENTS IN THE LAST YEAR WHERE IT SEEMED LIKE SHE MIGHT BE SACRIFICED OR WHERE SHE MIGHT BE IN BIG TROUBLE ZUCKERBERG HAS EXPRESSED HIS LOYALTY TO HER 
POD1000000029_S0000027	BUT AS THE SCANDALS MULTIPLIED AND AS THEY STARTED TO TOUCH HER IN A WAY THEY NEVER HAD BEFORE IT SEEMED AS THOUGH HER POSITION WAS AT RISK AND IT IS ALSO CERTAINLY THE CASE THAT THE PUBLIC REPUTATION OF BOTH OF THEM HAS DROPPED 
POD1000000029_S0000028	A YEAR AGO WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EACH OF THEM AS POTENTIAL PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES NOW THERE'S NOT A CHANCE 
POD1000000029_S0000029	WHAT ABOUT THE MORALE IN THE WIDER COMPANY IN THE WAKE OF ALL OF THIS DO YOU GET THE FEELING FROM THE PEOPLE YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO AND YOUR REPORTING THAT EMPLOYEES ARE FAIRLY SATISFIED THERE AND THAT I'M LAUGHING EVEN AS I SAY THAT OR IS THERE A WHOLE LOT OF INTERNAL CHAOS AT THIS COMPANY 
POD1000000029_S0000030	THERE IS A LOT MORE EMPLOYEE DISSATISFACTION THAN THERE WAS TWO YEARS 
POD1000000029_S0000031	AGO THERE ARE LOTS OF EMPLOYEES WHO I TALK TO THERE WHO SAY OH THIS PLACE IS GREAT IT'S COOL YOU KNOW THE MEDIA HATES US BUT THAT'S NOT MY PROBLEM I'M HAPPY UM AND THERE ARE A BUNCH OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO SAY YOU KNOW WE DESERVE A LOT OF THE HATRED WE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES 
POD1000000029_S0000032	WE TRAMPLED ON PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AND YOU KNOW I REGRET ALL THAT WE'VE DONE I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT GOING TO WORK THERE AND IT DOESN'T HAVE THE HALO THAT IT DID TWO YEARS AGO 
POD1000000029_S0000033	THEY STILL PAY YOU WELL THE FACT THAT THE STOCK CONTINUES TO GO UP IS GREAT PARTICULARLY FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE OPTIONS 
POD1000000029_S0000034	BUT IT IS A LESS EXCITING PLACE TO WORK AND THAT IS ONE OF THE TRUE RISKS FOR THE COMPANY AND ONE OF THE MOST ADVERSE EFFECTS OF THE LAST TWO YEARS FOR FACEBOOK 
POD1000000029_S0000035	AH DID ANY PART IN THIS REPORTING PARTICULARLY YOU KNOW GIVE HOW MUCH TIME YOU'VE SPENT ON FACEBOOK DIRECTLY NOW DID ANYTHING REALLY SURPRISE YOU 
POD1000000029_S0000036	THERE WAS ONE SPECIFIC STORY THAT STUNNED ME AND THAT WAS THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT LED TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE TWO FOUNDERS OF INSTAGRAM KEVIN SYSTROM AND MIKE KRIEGER 
POD1000000029_S0000037	AND WHEN FRED VOGELSTEIN AND I STARTED REPORTING THE STORY AND WE MADE A LIST OF THE MYSTERIES WE WANTED TO SOLVE AND THAT WAS AT THE VERY TOP WHY HAD THEY LEFT IT SEEMED STRANGE THEY HAD LEFT ALL OF A SUDDEN IN SEPTEMBER 
POD1000000029_S0000038	NO ONE KNEW WHY AND LATE IN THE REPORTING YOU KNOW MONTHS INTO REPORTING THE STORY WE FINALLY LEARNED THE FULL STORY AND THAT IS THAT ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THEM THEY HAD GROWN FRUSTRATED WITH ZUCKERBERG'S INCREASED MEDDLING 
POD1000000029_S0000039	THEY DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA THAT INSTAGRAM WAS GONNA BE FURTHER MERGED WITH WHATSAPP AND WITH FACEBOOK AND THERE WAS REAL TENSION OVER INSTAGRAM'S GROWTH 
POD1000000029_S0000040	AND THERE WAS A SENSE AMONG SOME PEOPLE AT FACEBOOK THAT INSTAGRAM'S GROWTH WAS COMING AT THE EXPENSE OF CORE FACEBOOK AND THAT LED TO ALL KINDS OF TENSIONS AND THEN A BIG FIGHT AT THE END OF JULY AND A MOMENT WHERE MARK ZUCKERBERG 
POD1000000029_S0000041	ACCORDING TO PEOPLE WHO OBSERVING ALL OF THIS ASKED ONE OF HIS DEPUTIES TO DRAW UP A LIST OF ALL THE WAYS THAT FACEBOOK SUPPORTED INSTAGRAM THE WAY IT DROVE USERS TOWARDS INSTAGRAM 
POD1000000029_S0000042	AND THEN HE GAVE THE LIST TO KEVIN SYSTROM AND SAID WE'RE GETTING RID OF ALL OF THESE AND ACCORDING TO PEOPLE FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY SYSTROM REACTED QUITE BADLY TO THAT AND THEN WENT ON PATERNITY LEAVE CAME BACK AND SAID I'M DONE HERE 
POD1000000029_S0000043	AND SO THE BIGGEST SURPRISE TO US WAS THAT THE DEPARTURE OF SYSTROM AND KRIEGER WHICH HADN'T COME OUT BEFORE WAS MUCH TENSER MUCH TENSER THAN I HAD BELIEVED WHEN I BEGAN REPORTING THE STORY 
POD1000000029_S0000044	NICK THOMPSON EDITOR-IN-CHIEF OF WIRED FOR CONTEXT A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR FINE WOULD BE A RECORD TECH PENALTY IN THE U S BITTING THE TWENTY-TWO MILLION THE GOOGLE HAVE TO PAY IN TWENTY TWELVE 
POD1000000029_S0000046	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS THE NEW YORK TIMES HAS A GOOD EXPLAINER ON WHY BOTH FACEBOOK AND THE F T C WOULD BE HAPPY WITH A CHUNKY FINE ONE ENDS UP LOOKING STRONG THE OTHER LOOKS ACCOUNTABLE BUT REALLY NOTHING MUCH CHANGES 
POD1000000029_S0000047	EUROPEAN REGULATORS HAVE BEEN TOUGHER ON TECH COMPANIES GOOGLE FACEBOOK AND TWITTER ALL HAVE TO DO MORE TO TACKLE FAKE NEWS TO SATISFY THEM AND THEY WANT TO SEE PROGRESS AHEAD OF E U ELECTIONS NEXT MONTH THAT'S ACCORDING TO REUTERS 
POD1000000029_S0000048	AND EVEN CANADA'S GETTING IN ON THE ACTION ACCORDING TO THE C B C THIS WEEK PRIVACY REGULATORS THERE SAY FACEBOOK BROKE SEVERAL LAWS OVER UNAUTHORIZED DATA ACCESS THEY PLAN TO TAKE THE COMPANY TO COURT 
POD1000000029_S0000049	IF YOU ENJOYED MARK ZUCKERBERG'S TESTIMONY IN FRONT OF CONGRESS HERE IN THE U S WITH HIS ZINGING COMEBACKS LIKE SENATOR WE RUN ADS THEN MAYBE YOU'LL ENJOY HEARING MORE DIRECTLY FROM MR ZUCKERBERG HIMSELF 
POD1000000029_S0000050	I MEAN FACEBOOK WAS ACCUSED OF NOT BEING OPEN ENOUGH I'M NOT REALLY SURE HOW DEEP INTO THE HEADS OF TECH ENTREPRENEURS YOU REALLY WANT TO GET BUT ZUCK HAS A PODCAST NOW I'M NOT SUGGESTING YOU LISTEN I'M JUST GIVING YOU THIS INFORMATION 
POD1000000029_S0000051	IT'S CALLED TECH AND SOCIETY WITH MARK ZUCKERBERG JUST YEAH DON'T AT ME MY PUDDY PRODUCE THIS WEEKS MARKETPLACE TECH ALONG WITH STEPHANIE HUGHES AND EACH ROW IS A SENIOR PRODUCER 
POD1000000029_S0000053	I'M JACK STEWART FOR NOW THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH THIS IS A P M 
POD1000000029_S0000055	THIS IS A P M 
POD1000000033_S0000001	IF YOU WANT TO GET BROADBAND ACCESS TO EVERY STATE YOU GOTTA KNOW THE LOCAL LAWS FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DEMYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M MOLLY WOOD 
POD1000000033_S0000003	THE DIGITAL ECONOMY AS WE LIKE TO CALL IT OVER HERE DEPENDS PRETTY HEAVILY ON ACCESS TO THE INTERNET AND THAT IS STILL NOT A SOLVED PROBLEM HERE IN THE UNITED STATES 
POD1000000033_S0000004	OVER THIRTY PERCENT OF AMERICANS DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO BROADBAND INTERNET WHICH IS DEFINED AS TWENTY-FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND OR HIGHER THAT'S ACCORDING TO RESEARCH RELEASED TUESDAY BY THE N P D GROUP 
POD1000000033_S0000005	THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS HAS AN INITIATIVE DEDICATED TO FIGURING OUT WHY THIS IS THE CASE TODAY THE ORGANIZATION'S BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE IS LAUNCHING A NEW TOOL THAT LETS ANYONE BROWSE THROUGH BROADBAND POLICIES AND FUNDING IN ANY STATE IN THE U S 
POD1000000033_S0000006	IT SORTS THE INFORMATION IN CATEGORIES LIKE FUNDING COMPETITION AND REGULATION INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESS AND BROADBAND DEFINITIONS 
POD1000000033_S0000007	LIKE IN ALABAMA FOR EXAMPLE BROADBAND SPEED IS DEFINED AS ONLY TEN MEGABITS FOR SECONDS IF YOUR NETWORK IS BUSY THAT'S BARELY FAST ENOUGH TO STREAM NETFLIX AND HIGH DEATH 
POD1000000033_S0000008	KATHRYN DE WIT MANAGES THE BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE FOR THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS SHE TOLD ME STATE POLICY IS A HUGE DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO EXPANDING BROADBAND ACCESS 
POD1000000033_S0000009	STATE POLICY MATTERS BECAUSE LACK OF ACCESS TO BROADBAND IS A NATIONAL ISSUE BUT IT IS FELT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AND STATES HAVE TAKEN A PRETTY AGGRESSIVE APPROACH TO CLOSING GAPS IN ACCESS PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS 
POD1000000033_S0000010	WE'VE SEEN A SIGNIFICANT UPTICK IN LEGISLATION SINCE TWENTY-FIFTEEN UM AND WHAT WE CAN TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS NOT ONLY DO STATE POLICY MAKERS SEE AND FEEL THAT IMMEDIATE URGENCY OF AH LACK OF BROADBAND ACCESS 
POD1000000033_S0000011	THAT'S THEY'RE SAYING IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINGS LIKE EDUCATION HEALTH CARE AND AH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS BUT THEY'RE ALSO SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANT OUR STATE TO LOOK LIKE THEY'RE SETTING GOALS AND THEN THEY'RE LAYING OUT A PATH AND A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW TO ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS 
POD1000000033_S0000012	LET'S JUST DIVE INTO SOME OF WHAT IS IN THE TOOL SOME OF THE DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES ARE TAKING LIKE COULD YOU GIVE ME AN EXAMPLE OF TWO TOTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACHES THAT STATES MIGHT HAVE TAKEN 
POD1000000033_S0000013	SO GOING INTO THIS RESEARCH WE KNEW THAT STATES AH FACE SIMILAR CHALLENGES IN INCREASING ACCESS TO BROADBAND AH BUT WE LEARNED THAT THEY'RE ALSO TAKING SIMILAR APPROACHES BUT ADAPTING AH THEM TO THEIR NEEDS THAT'S REALLY WHERE THOSE CATEGORIES CAME FROM THOSE GROUPINGS 
POD1000000033_S0000014	AH IF YOU LOOK AT GOALS FOR EXAMPLE AH YOU HAVE STATES LIKE MINNESOTA AND WEST VIRGINIA WHERE THEIR STATEWIDE BROADBAND GOALS ARE FOCUSED ON BORDER-TO-BORDER UNIVERSAL COVERAGE 
POD1000000033_S0000015	THEN YOU LOOK AT A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA AH THAT HAS A GOAL TO CONNECT NINETY-EIGHT PERCENT OF THE POPULATION AND EACH ONE OF ITS ROUGHLY TWENTY REGIONS 
POD1000000033_S0000016	HOW DO YOU HOPE THAT A TOOL LIKE THIS CAN HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN TERMS OF BROADBAND ACCESS 
POD1000000033_S0000017	WELL THIS TOOL IS ACTUALLY THE FIRST STEP IN OUR ONGOING RESEARCH ON HOW STATES ARE ADDRESSING GAPS IN BROADBAND ACCESS SO FOR US THIS WAS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT FIFTY-STATE LANDSCAPE OF BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT LAWS 
POD1000000033_S0000018	AND IT PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR OUR NEXT LEVEL OF RESEARCH WHICH IS A DEEPER EXAMINATION OF HOW STATES ARE ADDRESSING THOSE GAPS IN ACCESS 
POD1000000033_S0000019	WHAT WE HOPE THOUGH IS THAT AH USERS WILL BE ABLE TO USE THIS TOOL TO LEARN WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY DOING IT 
POD1000000033_S0000020	KATHRYN DE WIT MANAGES THE BROADBAND RESEARCH INITIATIVE FOR THE PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS WE'VE GOT A LINK TO THAT NEW TOOL AND SOME ANALYSIS ABOUT SPENDING PER STATE AT OUR WEBSITE MARKETPLACE TECH DOT ORG 
POD1000000033_S0000022	AND NOW FOR SOME RELATED LINKS SO THIS TOOL IS SUPER NEW OBVIOUSLY AND PEW HOPES THAT POLICYMAKERS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WILL JUMP IN AND START CREATING SOME MORE ANALYSIS AND COMPARISON AND OF COURSE THEY'LL BE PUBLISHING THEIR OWN PIECES 
POD1000000033_S0000023	THE FIRST ONE THAT I MENTIONED THERE IS ABOUT HOW STATES FUND THEIR BROADBAND PROJECTS WHETHER IT'S GRANTS OR LOANS OR GENERAL FUNDS KIND OF THINGS OR SOME CREATIVE FUNDING 
POD1000000033_S0000024	APPARENTLY ILLINOIS MAKES INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS PAY INTO A SPECIAL COFFER CALLED THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ELIMINATION FUND AND IT USES THAT TO PAY FOR BROADBAND BUILDOUTS 
POD1000000033_S0000025	AND IN VIRGINIA A LEGAL SETTLEMENT WITH TOBACCO PRODUCERS IS PAYING TO BUILD MORE INTERNET 
POD1000000033_S0000026	LOOK I'M NOT SAYING THIS ISN'T A LITTLE WONKY OVER HERE BUT IT IS INTERESTING ALSO I GOT TO BE HONEST I'M STILL HUNG UP ON THAT TEN MEGABITS PER SECOND IN ALABAMA AND PROBABLY SOME OTHER STATES TOO I HAVEN'T MADE IT THROUGH THE ENTIRE TOOL YET 
POD1000000033_S0000027	BUT ALABAMA'S REGULATION ALSO SAYS I S P'S CAN CALL THEIR UPLOAD SPEEDS BROADBAND AT ONE MEGABIT PER SECOND SO BASICALLY IF YOU ARE AT HOME TRYING TO UPLOAD SOME PHOTOS TO FACEBOOK OR ANYTHING TO THE CLOUD EVER 
POD1000000033_S0000028	YOU'D BE DOING THAT AT SPEEDS TEN TIMES SLOWER THAN THE SLOWEST FOUR G CELLPHONE CONNECTION SET IT AND FORGET IT CAUSE IT'S GONNA TAKE ALL NIGHT 
POD1000000033_S0000029	ANOTHER SPEED QUESTION IS SO CONTROVERSIAL THAT EVEN THOUGH PEW IS USING THE TWENTY-FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND SPEED GUIDELINE WHICH IS SET BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION NETWORK CONGESTION USUALLY MEANS ACTUAL SPEEDS ARE NOWHERE NEAR THAT FAST 
POD1000000033_S0000030	AND AGAIN A FOUR G PHONE CONNECTION IS FASTER THAN THAT ON THE BEST PROVIDERS 
POD1000000033_S0000031	IT IS SUCH A BIG DISCREPANCY THAT WHILE PEW SAYS TWENTY-ONE MILLION AMERICANS DON'T HAVE BROADBAND MICROSOFT PUT OUT ITS OWN MAP OF HIGH-SPEED INTERNET ACCESS BACK IN APRIL 
POD1000000033_S0000032	IT SAID THE REAL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WITHOUT APPROPRIATELY FAST INTERNET ACCESS FOR TODAY'S ECONOMY IS MORE LIKE A HUNDRED-AND-SIXTY-THREE MILLION IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE 
POD1000000033_S0000034	I'M MOLLY WOOD AND THAT'S MARKETPLACE TECH 
POD1000000033_S0000036	THIS IS A P M 
POD1000000038_S0000001	LET'S TAKE A BREAK FROM REAL LIFE FOR A MOMENT TO VISIT THE SOMEWHAT NEAR FUTURE ON T V 
POD1000000038_S0000002	ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO WARN YOU THAT'S KINDA DARK TOO 
POD1000000038_S0000003	FROM AMERICAN PUBLIC MEDIA THIS IS MARKETPLACE TECH DE MYSTIFYING THE DIGITAL ECONOMY I'M MOLLY WOOD 
POD1000000038_S0000005	THE B B C H B O SHOW YEARS AND YEARS COMBINES THE POLITICS ECONOMY AND TECH OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND IMAGINES HOW IT ALL MIGHT EVOLVE OVER THE NEXT FIFTEEN YEARS 
POD1000000038_S0000006	EMMA THOMPSON IS IN IT AS A CELEBRITY BRITISH POLITICIAN WITH AUTOCRATIC LEANINGS BUT MAINLY THE SHOW FOLLOWS A FAMILY AS THEY DEAL WITH THE WORLD CHANGING AROUND THEM 
POD1000000038_S0000007	RUSSELL T DAVIES CREATED AND WROTE YEARS AND YEARS HE'S ALSO WORKED ON SHOWS DOCTOR WHO TORCHWOOD AND CREATED QUEER AS FOLK 
POD1000000038_S0000008	HE SAID THE TECH IN YEARS AND YEARS IS LIKE LIFE IT'S COMPLICATED 
POD1000000038_S0000010	SHOW GOOD AND BAD I THINK SOME OF THE SADDEST MOMENTS IS IS YOU YOU HAVE A WORLD WAR BEING ANNOUNCED ON TELEVISION AND THE LITTLE FIVE SIX-YEAR-OLD KIDS JUST SIT AND STARING INTO THEIR PHONES PLAYING THEIR GAMES 
POD1000000038_S0000011	SO YES THERE'S BAD STUFF BUT THAT'S VERY EASY TO TALK ABOUT AND YET THERE'S VERY VERY GOOD STUFF I TELL YOU ACTUALLY WHEN I MADE THE CHOICE TO CENTER THIS AROUND A FAMILY 
POD1000000038_S0000012	THAT CAME FROM ONE OF THE GOOD SIDES OF CURRENT TECH WHICH IS VERY SIMPLY THE WHATSAPP GROUP I'M ONE OF THREE KIDS AND TWO SISTERS HAVE TWO KIDS EACH WE'RE A NICE FAMILY WE ALL LIKE EACH OTHER WE GET ALONG 
POD1000000038_S0000013	BUT UP UNTIL A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO AS MY NIECES HAVE GROWN UP TWO THREE YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE TEXTED THEM TWICE A YEAR HAPPY BIRTHDAY AND MERRY CHRISTMAS NOW OH MY GOD I WENT OUT THE OTHER NIGHT AND I CAME BACK TO THE WHATSAPP GROUP FIFTY-THREE MESSAGES 
POD1000000038_S0000015	BECAUSE SOMEONE HAD COOKED A LASAGNA WITH BUTTERNUT SQUASH SO YES THERE'S GOOD STUFF IF YOU CHOOSE EITHER GOOD OR EITHER BAD YOU'RE NOT MAKE IT RIGHT YOU'VE GOT TO GET BOTH IN THERE BECAUSE IN THE END IT'S NOT THE TECHNOLOGY IT'S IT'S THE PEOPLE 
POD1000000038_S0000016	WELL IT'S GREAT BECAUSE SOME OF THE TECH FEELS REALLY IMMEDIATE LIKE A HEADBAND THAT PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC SORT OF SNAPCHAT FILTER FOR YOUR FACE THAT EVERYONE CAN SEE IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD IT'S FUTURISTIC BUT IT'S ALSO COMPLETELY REALISTIC 
POD1000000038_S0000017	YES YES I THINK IF THAT WAS INVENTED TOMORROW WE'D ALL GO AND BUY ONE I MEAN I FIND THOSE FILTERS FASCINATING 
POD1000000038_S0000019	SENDS EACH OTHER PHOTOS OF THEMSELVES LOOKING LIKE A DOG 
POD1000000038_S0000021	RASH OF INSTAGRAM FILTERS LIKE WHAT DOG ARE YOU OR WHAT CAKE ARE YOU I'M CERTAINLY A BATTENBERG BUT I LOVE THOSE FILTERS AND I'M FASCINATED BY THE WAY WE LOVE THOSE FILTERS 
POD1000000038_S0000022	AND SO THE MOMENT SOMEONE INVENTS A FILTER YOU CAN SEE IN THE REAL WORLD NOT JUST ON YOUR PHONE OH MY GOD I WOULD BE PHONING YOU FROM MY PALACE ON THE MOON 
POD1000000038_S0000023	DO YOU HAVE CONFLICTING YOU KNOW FEELINGS ABOUT TECH OR IS IT LIKE SO MANY THINGS WHERE IT JUST REFLECTS THE REAL WORLD 
POD1000000038_S0000024	YEAH IT'S INTERESTING AH I THINK IT'S BOTH I THINK I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE ENTERTAINING BUT ENTERTAINING DOESN'T MEAN BEING GLIB OR DAFT UM I THINK I'M GETTING OLDER I THINK MY STUFF IS FULL OF WARNINGS NOW TO BE HONEST IT'S FUNNY NOW I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF AN EDIT OF MY NEXT DRAMA 
POD1000000038_S0000026	H B O MAX OVER THERE WHICH IS ABOUT THE AIDS CRISIS OF THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES 
POD1000000038_S0000028	I'VE JUST WATCHED AN EDIT OF AN EPISODE WARNING ABOUT VIRUSES AND WE STEP OUT OF OUR FRONT DOORS AND THERE'S A VIRUS ON THE LOOSE IT'S YOU CAN'T LEARN THOSE LESSONS FROM HISTORY ENOUGH STRANGELY WHAT A WORLD 
POD1000000038_S0000029	I WAS TELLING PEOPLE THAT I'M TAKING A LITTLE BIT OF COMFORT IN A DARKER TIMELINE LIKE THERE IS SOMETHING COMFORTING ABOUT THE PASSAGE OF TIME RIGHT LIKE YOU FAST FORWARD IN THESE EPISODES AND INCREASINGLY TERRIBLE THINGS HAPPEN BUT ALSO 
POD1000000038_S0000030	PEOPLE ARE STILL LIVING THEIR NORMAL LIVES TALK TO ME ABOUT THE SENSE OF PERSPECTIVE 
POD1000000038_S0000031	YES THAT'S RIGHT I MEAN IT'S IT WAS QUITE A HARD SHOW TO SELL INITIALLY WITH ITS CONCEPT OF MOVING FORWARD IN TIME AND EVERY EPISODE MOVES FORWARD A YEAR UM BUT ACTUALLY I SAT THERE SAYING 
POD1000000038_S0000033	BEEN QUESTIONED ABOUT FIFTY-SEVEN TIMES 
POD1000000038_S0000035	DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE MOVES FORWARD A YEAR IN EVERY EPISODE DOWNTON ABBEY 
POD1000000038_S0000036	AND SO DID UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS MANY YEARS AGO IT'S ACTUALLY NOT A FORM OF DRAMA I'VE INVENTED IT'S SIMPLY THAT THIS DRAMA IS GOING TO THE FUTURE AH BY A YEAR EVERY EPISODE THAT HAD PEOPLE SCARED BUT IN TERMS OF DRAMA IN TERMS OF HOW THE CHARACTERS ARE GETTING ON WHO LOVES WHO 
POD1000000038_S0000037	WHO'S GOING OUT WITH WHO WHO'S CROSS WITH WHO WHO LOVES WHO TO TAKE YEARLY JUMPS IN THERE IT'S A VERY SIMPLE DRAMATIC DEVICE SO UM 
POD1000000038_S0000038	I KNEW THAT WOULD WORK I HAD THE THE CONFIDENCE OF THOSE THOSE FOREBEARS TO SAY THIS WILL WORK AND UM 
POD1000000038_S0000039	AND IT WAS TO GET SORT OF CREEP INTO THE STORY WHICH WHICH IS 
POD1000000038_S0000041	IN IN SOCIETIES WHEN DICTATORS ARISE OR WHERE HUGE CHANGES ARE MADE AND AND WHERE SOCIETY MIGHT SWING FROM LEFT TO RIGHT OR RIGHT TO LEFT IT DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT THAT'S WHY I WANTED 
POD1000000038_S0000042	WHAT ENDS UP AS LIKE A FIFTEEN-YEAR SPAN ON THE SHOW IS IS TO SHOW SHOW THESE THINGS SLOWLY CREEPING UP ON YOU AND ACTUALLY YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED WITH HAVING A TEA OR OR FALLING IN LOVE 
POD1000000038_S0000043	OR OR HAVING A DIVORCE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE STUFF THE MEAT AND DRINK OF YOUR LIFE WHILE THE BIGGER SHADOWS ARE FALLING ON YOU UNSEEN SO I NEEDED THAT STRETCH TO SHOW THE SMALL PICTURE OF PEOPLE LIVING WITHIN A BIGGER PICTURE 
POD1000000038_S0000044	SO EPISODE SIX INTRODUCES A VIRUS AND WITH THE CORONAVIRUS'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW I WONDER IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY 
POD1000000038_S0000045	IN THE SHOW WAS THAT JUST ONE OF THE MANY SERVE THINGS GOING ON IN THE FUTURE 
POD1000000038_S0000046	IT'S INTERESTING CAUSE CAUSE ACTUALLY IT COMES UP IN EPISODE SIX AS AS A MEANS OF ISOLATING PEOPLE WITHIN THE STORY AH TO TO BE HONEST UM NOW I'M SEEING A VIRUS LIKE THIS IN ACTION 
POD1000000038_S0000047	IT IT WOULD HAVE DOMINATED EPISODE SIX TOO MUCH IT'S AMAZING HOW IT DOMINATES AH EVERY CONVERSATION NOW AND EPISODE SIX AS A DRAMA NOT NOT AS A DOCUMENT OF THE REAL WORLD BUT AS A DRAMA HAS STORIES TO WRAP UP 
POD1000000038_S0000049	WE NEED TO KNOW 
POD1000000038_S0000050	WHETHER LOVERS WILL BE REUNITED WHETHER MARRIAGES WILL STAY TOGETHER SO IT'S VERY INTERESTING NOW THAT I THOUGHT THINK THAT'S I'VE HAD DONE A LOT OF RESEARCH INTO VIRUSES AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN SO I KIND OF YOU KNOW I KNEW I KNEW THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ENDEMICS AND PANDEMICS 
POD1000000038_S0000051	BUT I CHOSE THE BACKGROUND IT AND UM THIS IS A SEPARATE DRAMA IN ITSELF REALLY MY GOODNESS THIS IS SOME STRANGE DAYS AGAIN JUST KEEP GETTING MADDER WHAT DID WE USED TO TALK ABOUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX WHAT WHAT DID WE TALK ABOUT CAN YOU REMEMBER INTEREST RATES

POD1000000047_S0000000	WELCOME TO THE EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS PODCAST THIS INTERVIEW WITH DAVID SPIEGELHALTER IS A BIT UNUSUAL AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY RECORDED TWO YEARS AGO 
POD1000000047_S0000002	WE WILL CONSIDERING A STARTING PODCAST BACK THEN AND I RECORDED THIS TRIAL EPISODE WITH MY COLLEAGUE JESS WHITTLESTONE BUT ULTIMATELY WE DIDN'T HAVE THE TIME TO GO ON AHEAD WITH THE PROJECT BUT I THOUGHT WHY NOT DIG IT UP AND RELEASE IT NOW 
POD1000000047_S0000004	DAVID SPIEGELHALTER IS A STATISTICIAN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE AND SOMETHING OF AN ACADEMIC CELEBRITY IN THE U K 
POD1000000047_S0000006	PART OF HIS ROLE IS TO IMPROVE THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK ESPECIALLY EVERYDAY RISKS WE FACE LIKE GETTING CANCER OR DYING IN A CAR CRASH AS A RESULT HE'S REGULARLY IN THE MEDIA EXPLAINING THE NUMBERS IN THE NEWS 
POD1000000047_S0000007	TRYING TO ASSIST BOTH ORDINARY PEOPLE AND POLITICIANS TO FOCUS ON THE MOST IMPORTANT RISKS THAT CONFRONT US AND AVOID BEING DISTRACTED BY FLASHY RISKS THAT PERHAPS DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE THAT MUCH IMPACT 
POD1000000047_S0000009	TO HELP MAKE SENSE OF THE UNCERTAINTIES WE FACE IN LIFE HE'S HAD TO INVENT CONCEPTS LIKE THE MICRO LIFE OR A THIRTY MINUTE CHANGE IN LIFE EXPECTANCY 
POD1000000047_S0000011	WE GAVE HIM A CALL BECAUSE WE WANTED TO LEARN WEATHER HE THOUGHT A LIFETIME OF WORK HAD ACTUALLY MADE THAT MUCH DIFFERENCE TO THE WORLD ENJOY 
POD1000000047_S0000013	HERE AT THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM WE'RE INTERESTED IN FINDING WAYS TO COMPARE WHAT IT MEANS TO DO GOOD AND TO FIGURE OUT WHICH WAYS OF DOING GOOD DO THE MOST GOOD SO WE ASK QUESTION LIKE WHICH CHARITY SHOULD YOU DONATE TO IF YOU WANT TO HELP AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE 
POD1000000047_S0000014	WHAT CAREERS SHOULD YOU FOLLOW IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE THE WORLD AND WHICH CAUSE AREAS HAVE THE LARGEST IMPACT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK IT REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET CLEAR SO YOU KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE 
POD1000000047_S0000016	TO HELP US ANSWER SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS WE'RE JOINED BY PROFESSOR DAVID SPIEGELHALTER THE WILTON PROFESSOR FOR THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISK AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SPIEGELHALTER SPENT MUCH OF HIS LIFE TRYING TO IMPROVE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS SCIENCE AND RISK IN ORDINARY LIFE 
POD1000000047_S0000018	HE REGULARLY APPEARS IN THE U K MEDIA AND WRITES ON HIS BLOG UNDERSTANDING UNCERTAINLY IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU WITH US TODAY DAVID 
POD1000000047_S0000019	HI 
POD1000000047_S0000021	SO WE'VE GOT SO MANY THINGS WE'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT AH WE'LL SEE HOW FAR WE GET BUT FIRST TELL US A BIT ABOUT YOUR WHO YOU ARE AND YOUR POSITION 
POD1000000047_S0000022	YEAH YEAH I'VE GOT A STRANGE JOB REALLY I'M IN THE MATH'S DEPARTMENT AT CAMBRIDGE AND I TEACH STATISTICS TO THE UNDERGRADUATES BUT I'M ACTUALLY FUNDED BY A HEDGE FUND WINTON CAPITAL MANAGEMENT AND AND THAT MUCH IN ORDER TO IMPROVE 
POD1000000047_S0000023	THE PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF STATICS AND RISK AND SO AH WHAT I'VE DONE SINCE I'VE HAD THAT JOB FOR THE LAST EIGHT YEARS IS I SUPPOSE TO TRY TO JOIN THE GENERAL COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO ARE 
POD1000000047_S0000024	TRYING TO IMPROVE THE WAY NUMBERS IN PARTICULAR ARE DISCUSSED IN SOCIETY 
POD1000000047_S0000026	SO WHAT KINDS OF QUESTIONS DO YOU RESEARCH AND WHAT OUTREACH DO YOU DO TO HELP THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND NUMBERS AND UNCERTAINLY BETTER 
POD1000000047_S0000027	WELL I GET ASKED TO DO A HUGE AMOUNT OF STUFF I SUPPOSE HELPING IN AH VARIOUS AGENCIES COMMUNICATING RISK UM YOU KNOW ABOUT CERTAIN CANCER RISK ABOUT THE RISK OF THE THE THE SCREENING FOR EXAMPLE RISKS AND BENEFITS OF SCREENING I I UM MY BACKGROUND IS IN MEDICAL STATISTICS 
POD1000000047_S0000028	SO THAT'S WHAT I GET TO DO QUITE A LOT BUT I'VE DONE AH T V PROGRAMS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE I'VE DONE AH RADIO STUFF ABOUT UM YOU KNOW ALL SORTS OF THREATS TO SOCIETY FROM FUKUSHIMA AND AND SO ON 
POD1000000047_S0000029	AND EVERYTHING TO DO WITH AND TRYING TO GET A HANDLE ON YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE IMPORTANT THREATS TO TO US INDIVIDUALLY AND WHAT WOULD WHY MY HOW WE MIGHT GO TO MAKE COMPARISONS BETWEEN BETWEEN THEM SO 
POD1000000047_S0000030	UM I I M VERY INTERESTED IN RATHER THAN THE GREAT GLOBAL EXISTENTIAL RISKS SO I'M MORE INTERESTED IN THE THINGS THAT AFFECT US ALL INDIVIDUALLY ABOUT HOW WE EAT OR EXERCISE AND TRANSPORT AND SO ON 
POD1000000047_S0000032	SO YEAH ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I FIND VERY INTERESTING IN THIS AREA IS THAT THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT PEOPLE TEND TO BE VERY POOR AT ESTIMATING LOTS OF DIFFERENT PROBABILITIES AND SO END UP 
POD1000000047_S0000033	OVERESTIMATING THE SCALE OF THE SOME PROBLEMS OF RISK THAT THEY FACE AND UNDERESTIMATING OTHERS UM FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE WHAT KINDS OF PROBLEMS DO YOU THINK THAT PEOPLE TEND TO BE MOST PRONE TO OVERESTIMATE OR UNDERESTIMATE AND GET WRONG IN VERY HARMFUL WAYS 
POD1000000047_S0000034	WELL THE THE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF RESEARCH ON THIS BY PSYCHOLOGISTS AS YOU KNOW AND AND IT WAS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PEOPLE I ALWAYS INCLUDE MYSELF IN THIS 
POD1000000047_S0000035	YOU KNOW I'M A SUBJECT TO THE WHIMS MY EMOTIONAL GUT REACTIONS AS MUCH AS ANYBODY ELSE SO I M NOT MAKING ANY CLAIM ABOUT SOME SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE AND RATIONALITY COMPARED WITH EVERYBODY ELSE BECAUSE 
POD1000000047_S0000036	WE JUST KNOW THAT THE WAY WE RESPOND TO THINGS AH YOU KNOW TO SIMPLIFY YOU KNOW WE CAN THINK IN TWO DIFFERENT WAYS WE CAN RESPOND WITH OUR GUTS OR WE CAN TRY TO ENGAGE OUR BRAIN AND THINK SLOWLY ABOUT STUFF 
POD1000000047_S0000037	AND AND THIS SO RELEVANT WHEN IT COMES TO RISK AND AH PARTICULARLY THIS IDEA THE WHAT WHAT WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO US IS AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC IS VERY STRONG THAT 
POD1000000047_S0000038	WHAT WE HEAR IN THE NEWS WE WE HEAR ABOUT EBOLA WE HEAR ABOUT TERRORISM WE HEAR ABOUT YOU KNOW THE LATEST AH THREATS THAT MIGHT AH THAT MIGHT BE IN WHAT WE NEED SOME WAY WE TRAVEL AND WE GET VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS WELL THERE'S A PLANE CRASH OR WHATEVER 
POD1000000047_S0000039	AND BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S IN THE NEWS THAT'S WHAT'S IS AVAILABLE TO US SO YOU KNOW THIS WHAT SO PROMINENT BUT OF COURSE SO MANY OF THESE RISKS ARE ACTUALLY VERY SMALL INDEED THIS IS NOT A THREAT TO US PARTICULAR AT ALL 
POD1000000047_S0000040	AND AND THE THINGS THAT ARE MUCH MORE FAMILIAR WE DON'T HEAR MUCH OF YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE JUST IN HEART DISEASE CANCER ALL THE OTHER STUFF THAT WE GET AND LARGELY THE AMOUNT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE LIVE OUR LACK OF EXERCISE OUR CRUMMY DIET 
POD1000000047_S0000041	AND SO ON OF COURSE IS PEOPLE GET A BIT BORED WITH THAT BECAUSE AND AND DON'T GET SO CONCERNED ABOUT IT 
POD1000000047_S0000042	DO YOU FEEL YOU'VE HAD ANY SUCCESS IMPROVING PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING OF RISKS AND GETTING PEOPLE TO FOCUS ON THE STUFF THAT REALLY MATTERS 
POD1000000047_S0000043	OH I DON'T KNOW IT'S RIGHT FROM ASIA I MEAN AH IT'D BE GREAT TO THINK SO AND AH YEAH I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN SOME GOOD PROJECTS WITH ME I'M PROUD OF FOR EXAMPLE THE REDESIGN THE CANCER SCREENING LEAFLET IN THE U K WHICH AH PRESENT THE BENEFITS AND RISKS 
POD1000000047_S0000044	CANCER SCREENING IN A IN A VERY BALANCED WAY THEY THEY AH HUGELY INNOVATES IT INNOVATE IT IS THAT THEY DON'T ACTUALLY RECOMMEND PEOPLE GO FOR SCREENING THEY THEY JUST SAY THESE ARE THE POSSIBLE BENEFITS 
POD1000000047_S0000045	THESE ARE THE POSSIBLE HARMS MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND AND I I BELIEVE THAT'S THE RIGHT WAY TO GO ABOUT COMMUNICATING RISK IS NOT TO SAY OH YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH YOU'VE GOT TO WATCH OUT THIS IS TERRIBLE SAY WELL IF YOU DO THIS THIS MIGHT HAPPEN OR IT MIGHT NOT HAPPEN 
POD1000000047_S0000046	AND WEIGH IT UP AND AND ACTUALLY YOU MAY GIVE PEOPLE CREDIT FOR SOME INTELLIGENCE WHICH I THINK PEOPLE BASICALLY ARE DON'T THINK PEOPLE ARE SO STUPID BUT I'M PROUD OF IS BEING PART OF A GENERAL COMMUNITY THAT'S VERY STRONG IN BRITAIN TO DO WITH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IN SCIENCE 
POD1000000047_S0000047	AND 
POD1000000047_S0000049	WHICH I'M JUST THE SMALL PART OF THAT BECAUSE IT COVERS THE MATERIALS ON THE RADIO STUFF ON TELEVISION STUFF IN IN AH SOME NEWSPAPERS AND IN VARIOUS AGENCIES FOR EXAMPLE THE STATISTICS AUTHORITY 
POD1000000047_S0000050	WHICH IS JUST TRYING TO TAKE A MUCH MORE CRITICAL ATTITUDE TO THE WAY THAT NUMBERS AND EVIDENCE ARE USED IN SOCIETY AND I THINK IT'S IT WORKS IN IN BRITAIN WE'RE RATHER GOOD COMPARED WITH MOST PEOPLE ABOUT 
POD1000000047_S0000052	WE DON'T HAVE THESE MASSIVE FEARS OF OF VACCINATIONS OF NUCLEAR POWER OF OF EVEN G M OS AND AND SO I I I THINK THIS IS A SIGN THAT WE IN THIS COUNTRY HAVE DEVELOPED QUITE A GOOD AH PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT WITH SCIENCE COMMUNITY 
POD1000000047_S0000054	YEAH I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA ASK YOU ABOUT UM WHAT POTENTIAL YOU THINK THERE IS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THEIR CAREER GOING INTO A CAREER PATH SIMILAR TO YOUR OWN AND TRYING TO GET INTO PUBLIC OUTREACH AND ENGAGEMENT TO UM 
POD1000000047_S0000055	TO HAVE A BROADER IMPACT RATHER THAN NECESSARILY JUST DOING RESEARCH AND ACADEMIA SO AH HOW HARD DO YOU THINK IT IS TO DO THIS KIND OF THING AND IS IT IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING YOU WISH MORE ACADEMICS DID WORK ON UM 
POD1000000047_S0000056	ABSOLUTELY I MEAN I I REALLY CAME TO IT QUITE LATE AS AS A REAL PART OF MY CAREER AS I SAID AGAIN BECAUSE A PHILANTHROPIST AND IN A HEDGE FUND AND THAT PROVIDED THE FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS FULL TIME 
POD1000000047_S0000057	BUT I WAS DOING SOME BEFORE AS PART OF MY JOB AND I INCREASINGLY FEEL THAT ITS AH ACTUALLY A DUTY OF ACADEMICS WHO AFTER ALL ARE PUBLICLY FUNDED FOR A CERTAIN PROPORTION OF THEM TO REALLY SPEND SOME TIME ON PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IT DOESN'T SUIT EVERYBODY 
POD1000000047_S0000058	NOT EVERYBODY AT ALL ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE A WEBSITE EXPLAINING WHAT THEY DO AND AH AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE AH ALSO SUPPORTED AND THERE SHOULD BE INCENTIVES WITHIN THE CAREER STRUCTURE FOR ACADEMICS TO DO THIS 
POD1000000047_S0000059	I'M QUITE PLEASED IN CAMBRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT PROMOTION OF PEOPLE THEIR PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT IS TAKEN VERY SERIOUSLY INDEED IT IS SOMETHING I I I STRONGLY SUPPORT SO IT'S NOT EVERYBODY BUT I THINK IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT THING FOR ACADEMICS TO DO 
POD1000000047_S0000060	AND AS THEY'RE DOING THEIR WORK IT WAS IN WHATEVER AREA IT HAS A RELEVANCE TO SOCIETY AND IT CAN AH POTENTIALLY 
POD1000000047_S0000062	IMPROVE SOCIETY AND THEY SHOULD BE WORKING ON IT 
POD1000000047_S0000063	I I PERSONALLY THINK STATISTICS IS A PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AREA FOR IMPROVEMENT OF SOCIETY AND I FEEL THIS VERY STRONGLY AND MANY STATISTICIANS DO UM IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT 
POD1000000047_S0000064	THE ROYAL STATISTICAL SOCIETY HAS NOW GOT AN INITIATIVE OF TRAINING UP STATISTICS AMBASSADORS YOUNG STATISTICIANS WHO AH WHO WANT TO DO THIS WHO REALLY WANT TO GET OUT THERE AND COMMUNICATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR WORK AND TRY TO IMPROVE THE WAY THINGS ARE DONE WITH NUMBERS AND EVIDENCE 
POD1000000047_S0000065	UM I THINK THIS IS SO EXCITING SUCH FUN 
POD1000000047_S0000067	SO A LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE WE MEET ARE THINKING OF GOING INTO ACADEMIA DO FEEL LIKE THAT'S A A GOOD PLACE TO BE TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT IN THE WORLD OF COURSE THERE ARE ALSO SOME DRAWBACKS THAT YOU MIGHT AH BE AWARE OF FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE OF BEING IN ACADEMIA 
POD1000000047_S0000068	YES YEAH I'M NOT I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY SAY YOU KNOW TO RECOMMEND YES YOU REALLY SHOULD GO INTO ACADEMIA AND YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T SUIT EVERYBODY AND AND FRANKLY WHEN DID I STARTED IT'S QUITE YEAH IT IS VERY TOUGH NOW 
POD1000000047_S0000069	AH AH AH IN MOST CAREERS THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT MORE PRESSURES ON THAN THERE USED TO BE SO IT'S QUITE CAN BE QUITE A TOUGH CALL I THINK BUT THERE IS POTENTIAL TO DO A LOT OF GOOD STUFF AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE WORK PEOPLE I WORK WITH AND KNOW IN OTHER AREAS WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING IN 
POD1000000047_S0000070	NATURAL NATURAL UM YOU KNOW NATURAL THREATS NATURAL DISASTERS WHEN THEY'RE WORKING IN BOTANY WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING ANY AREA AND PLANT SCIENCES WHATEVER ARE A REALLY DEDICATED TO TRYING TO IMPROVE 
POD1000000047_S0000071	A LOT OF THE WORLD AND I'M I'M SO IMPRESSED BY THE DEDICATION BUT IT IS A TOUGH JOB AND YOU DON'T NECESSARILY SEE IN THIS SORT OF PUSH TO THE OTHER PUBLISH THE WORK YOU'VE GOT TO DO ALL THIS YOU'VE GOT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE SEVENTH 
POD1000000047_S0000073	ALL THIS BUSINESS IN ORDER TO BUILD ONE'S CAREER IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY APPEAR AT FIRST THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING A GREAT AND GOOD IN WHAT YOU DO VERY LITTLE OF IT YOU CAN SEE A DIRECT IMPACT HOWEVER AS I KNOW THAT I'M UM YOU KNOW WHAT'S VERY GOOD ABOUT IT IS THAT 
POD1000000047_S0000074	IT IT IS IT'S BUILDING A LOT OF TRANSFERABLE SKILLS THAT YOU CAN USE UM I FIND THAT IN MY STATISTICAL SKILLS FOR EXAMPLE ARE IN A MASSIVE DEMAND AND BY ALL SORTS OF AGENCIES UM I COULD POINT IN PARTICULAR TO THE 
POD1000000047_S0000075	IMPORTANCE OF THE MILLENNIAL DEVELOPMENT GOALS AND THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS WHICH ARE WHICH ARE UM 
POD1000000047_S0000076	WELL WHICH ARE REPLACING THEM IN WHICH THEY SORT OF MONITORING OF THE UM STATE OF OF OF THE WELFARE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD HAS BECOME ABSOLUTELY VITAL AND JUST BEING ABLE TO MEASURE THINGS AND KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON AND AH 
POD1000000047_S0000077	TO DEVELOP GOOD WAYS TO DO SURVEYS ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT WORKS AND HOW HOW YOU CAN UM IMPROVE THESE MEASURES IT IS HAS BECOME ENORMOUSLY VITAL ENORMOUSLY IMPORTANT SO I I THINK UM WELL AGAIN I'M COMING BACK TO I THINK STATISTICS IS 
POD1000000047_S0000078	PARTICULARLY VALUABLE AREA TO GO INTO 
POD1000000047_S0000080	YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE BROADLY THE KEY IDEA BEHIND EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM IS THAT WE WANT TO TRY AND FIGURE OUT WHICH ALTRUISTIC ACTIVITIES WHICH CHARITIES WHICH CAREER PATHS WHICH CAUSES DO THE MOST GOODS UM WE THINK THAT BEING ABLE TO 
POD1000000047_S0000081	MEASURE THINGS OR AT LEAST TRYING TO MEASURE THINGS IS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE IN MAKING PROGRESS ON THOSE QUESTIONS BUT OBVIOUSLY THESE ARE MANY OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO ANSWER SO A COMMON CRITICISM THAT WE OFTEN GET IS PEOPLE SAYING SOMETHING LIKE 
POD1000000047_S0000082	OH IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT WHICH CHARITIES OR CAREERS DO THE MOST GOOD SO YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TOUGH TIME TRYING AND YOU SHOULD JUST GO WITH YOUR GUT OR YOU KNOW HELP PERSONAL CAUSES UM WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS KIND OF OBJECTION AND DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO IT UM 
POD1000000047_S0000083	YOU KNOW CONCERN ABOUT THERE BEING TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY UM YOU KNOW WE OFTEN RESPOND BY SAYING THAT YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE SHOULDN'T TRY AND ESTIMATING THIS CLEARLY THE BEST WE HAVE BUT YEAH WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS CHALLENGE 
POD1000000047_S0000085	I MEAN THIS IS NOT A A COMMENT THAT'S UM JUST RESTRICTED TO AH THE AREA THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME USED TO HAPPEN IN HEALTHCARE IT IS SAID OH YOU CAN'T PUT A VALUE ON A HUMAN LIFE 
POD1000000047_S0000086	UM WE'VE JUST GO TO DO ALL WE CAN TO DO GOOD AND WE HAVE TO JUST GO WITH OUR GUTS ESSENTIALLY NO THAT THIS THAT VIEW NOW CERTAINLY IN THE U K HAS BEEN COMPLETELY DISCREDITED YOU CAN PUT A VALUE ON A HUMAN LIFE WE DO ALL THE TIME 
POD1000000047_S0000087	I'M SURE EVERYONE WOULD AGREE THAT 
POD1000000047_S0000088	NOT SURE EVERYONE YOU CAN AGREE AND OF COURSE 
POD1000000047_S0000089	BUT YOU HAVE TO 
POD1000000047_S0000090	BUT NICE FOR EXAMPLE HAS BEEN DOING THIS FOR OVER A DECADE 
POD1000000047_S0000092	PUTTING THE VALUE ON THE MARGINAL BENEFIT OF PARTICULAR HEALTHCARE INTERVENTION AND ASSESSING WHAT SHOULD BE SUPPORTED UNDER NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE ACCORDING TO REACH ALL THE CRITERIA AND WE KNOW THIS IS NOT PERFECT WE KNOW THIS DOES NOT MEASURE EVERYTHING 
POD1000000047_S0000093	BUT IT'S EXPLICIT IT'S TRANSPARENT AND THEY'VE DONE THEIR BEST AND I THINK IT'S A MASSIVE SUCCESS AND A HUGE EXAMPLE FOR OTHER COUNTRIES HOW YOU CAN GO ABOUT IT NOW WE KNOW IT IS A IT'S NEVER PERFECT IT'S NEVER PERFECT 
POD1000000047_S0000094	BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE THEN TRYING TO TAKE THAT APPROACH WHICH I THINK HAS BEEN EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL IN HEALTHCARE AND MOVE IT INTO ALL OTHER AREAS NOW HOW CAN YOU DO IT SO PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO DO IT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE THE VALUE OF A TREE WELL PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MEASURE THE VALUE OF A TREE 
POD1000000047_S0000095	AND I KNOW WHAT THE VALUE OF A TREE'S WORTH AND IT'S QUITE A LOT BUT 
POD1000000047_S0000097	WORKING OUT ALL THESE DIFFERENT TRYING TO MEASURE THE BENEFIT OF A OR HOW THE SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT ET CETERA WHAT'S THE VALUE OF A SPECIES WHAT'S THE VALUE OF THIS 
POD1000000047_S0000098	I MEAN I MEAN IT SEEMS IT'S IT'S TOO EASY TO SIT BACK AND SAY OH YOU CAN'T DO IT YOU CAN'T MEASURE THAT WELL WELL YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD GO YOU CAN HAVE A GOOD GO SO AS YOU SAY IT'S ALWAYS A BALANCE BETWEEN TRYING YOUR BEST REALIZING YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT 
POD1000000047_S0000099	BUT NOT TO BE PUT OFF HAVING A GOOD GO SO IT IT'S LIKE A LOT OF THINGS WE DO IN STATISTICS TRYING TO MEASURE THINGS TRYING TO MODEL THINGS THAT WE ALWAYS KNOW WHAT WE DO IS INADEQUATE BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T DO USEFUL THINGS 
POD1000000047_S0000101	CAN YOU TELL US A BIT MORE ABOUT NICE AND HOW THEY PRIORITIZED HEALTH TREATMENTS WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM 
POD1000000047_S0000102	YEAH I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE WORKED ON A MEDICAL STATISTICIAN I WOULD BE IN A HUGE SUPPORT OF NICE AND ESSENTIALLY UM WHAT THEY WHAT THEY DO IS WHEN THEY DECIDE WHETHER DECIDE TO HAVE A NEW VACCINE OR WHETHER DECIDE TO HAVE A NEW AH RECOMMEND AH 
POD1000000047_S0000103	SO FOR DRUGS TO BE PAID FOR UNDER THE N H S FOR EXAMPLE THEY WILL LOOK AT WHAT IS THE EXPECTED BENEFIT OF THAT OF THAT INTERVENTION AND WHAT'S THE EXPECTED COST AND THEN THEY LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT'S GONNA COST TO 
POD1000000047_S0000104	AND AH PROVIDE AN EXTRA OR THEY CALL IT QALY A QUALITY ADJUSTED LIFE YEAR SO ONE YEAR OF LIFE IT'S DISCOUNTED IF IT'S POOR QUALITY YOU WILL YOU WILL YOU WILL YOU WILL DISCOUNT IT IT WON'T BE WORTH A WHOLE YEAR AND ESSENTIALLY THEY CAN MAKE A COMPARISON 
POD1000000047_S0000105	AND THEY LOOK IF SOMETHING COMES IN LESS THAN TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS OF QALY AH JUST WHEN THEY JUST PAID FOR YOU KNOW JUST YEP FINE WE'LL PAY FOR IT UNDER THE N H S IF IT'S MORE THAN ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND THEN THEY REALLY TRY 
POD1000000047_S0000107	WE DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THIS 
POD1000000047_S0000108	AND TRY TO GO BACK TO THE DRUG COMPANY TO RENEGOTIATE A PRICE FOR EXAMPLE BETWEEN TWENTY THOUSAND AND THIRTY THOUSAND WOW YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S MORE IN THE GRAY ZONE SO AND THIS HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY BENEFICIAL PARTLY 
POD1000000047_S0000109	IN ORDER TO GO BACK TO DRUG COMPANIES AND GET THEM TO REDUCE THEIR PRICES BUT UM AND ALSO TO SEE THAT SOME INTERVENTIONS FOR EXAMPLE CANCER SCREENING COME IN EXTREMELY CHEAP THEY'RE JUST WORTH DOING IT IT ALSO MEANS YOU HAVE TO BE EXPLICIT FOR EXAMPLE IN HOW MUCH YOU VALUE THE FUTURE 
POD1000000047_S0000110	RATHER THAN THE PRESENT BECAUSE THEY PUT IN A DISCOUNT RATE CURRENTLY THREE AND A HALF PERCENT AND NOW THAT MEANS THAT AH AH A YEAR OF LIFE IN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS TIME FOR EXAMPLE IS ONLY WORTH ABOUT HALF WHAT A YEAR OF LIFE NOW IS WORTH AND AND THAT'S TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
POD1000000047_S0000111	AND NOW THAT THAT OF COURSE IS CONTROVERSIAL AND IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT BIG POLICY DECISIONS FOR EXAMPLE ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE THAT'S FAR TOO BIG A DISCOUNT RATE WE WOULDN'T CARE LESS ABOUT THE WORLD IN HUNDRED YEARS TIME IF WE USED THAT DISCOUNT RATE SO IN DIFFERENT AREAS 
POD1000000047_S0000112	YOU MIGHT BE WANTING TO USE A DIFFERENT DIS-DISCOUNT RATE BUT THESE ARE TAKING ECONOMIC IDEAS AND MOVING THEM INTO VERY HUMAN DECISIONS 
POD1000000047_S0000113	AND I THINK THEY ARE ENORMOUSLY HELPFUL AND ILLUMINATING BUT THEY'RE NEVER PERFECT 
POD1000000047_S0000115	YEAH I'VE ACTUALLY WRITTEN AN ARTICLE WITH AH PROFESSOR TOBY ORD ABOUT WHY WE SHOULDN'T DISCOUNT HEALTH EVEN THOUGH WE SHOULD DISCOUNT FINANCIAL RETURNS ABOUT WHY WHY IT'S APPROPRIATE IN ONE CASE AND NOT IN THE OTHER SO WE'LL PUT UP A LINK TO THAT AH ON THE WEBSITE AH SO 
POD1000000047_S0000116	A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PLANNING OUT THEIR CAREERS THEY FEEL JUST OVERWHELMED BY UNCERTAINTY THEY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THEY'RE GONNA EARN IN ONE CAREER OR WHAT'S THE CHANCES OF GETTING INTO ACADEMIA OR BEING ELECTED TO PARLIAMENT 
POD1000000047_S0000117	AH HOW DO YOU THINK PEOPLE OUGHT TO MAKE DECISIONS AH WHEN THEY'RE JUST SURROUNDED BY SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY 
POD1000000047_S0000118	WELL I MEAN YOU COULD SAY THAT WE'RE ALWAYS SURROUNDED ABOUT THIS AGAIN THIS IS COMMON TO EVERYTHING WE DO WE NEVER KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE WHICH IS GREAT PEOPLE DON'T DON'T WANNA KNOW WHAT'S GONNA TO HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY WANT WHAT THEY'RE GONNA GET FOR CHRISTMAS LET ALONE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES 
POD1000000047_S0000119	AND SO UM THE THIS IS JUST A COMMON PROBLEM AND WE NEED TO DISTINGUISH WHAT WE MIGHT CALL RISK AND UNCERTAINTY RISK IS WHEN IT'S A VERY WELL DEFINED PROBLEM THERE'S SHORT TERM ISSUES AND BUYING LOTTERY TICKETS WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE CHANCES ARE 
POD1000000047_S0000120	AND THEN WE CAN ALSO TAKE A RATIONAL APPROACH WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH DEEPER UNCERTAINTY WHEN REALLY ARE NOT EVEN SURE WHAT THE OPTIONS ARE OF HOW OUR LIVES MIGHT DEVELOP THEN UM IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO TAKE A COMPLETELY FORMAL APPROACH AND SAY UM I WOULDN'T 
POD1000000047_S0000121	TRY TO SAY OH WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO ALL THIS MATHEMATICALLY AT ALL HOWEVER THE BASICS OF QUALITIVE IDEAS OF THINKING THROUGH A RATIONAL DECISION ARE STILL VERY VALUABLE BECAUSE YOU THINK OF YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE 
POD1000000047_S0000122	WHAT ARE THE POSSIBILITIES AND AH YOU KNOW WHAT ARE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT I MIGHT DO NOW THAT'S ALWAYS INADEQUATE YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT THE THING AND HOWEVER BY THINKING THROUGH THAT SOME THINGS MIGHT COME IMMEDIATELY APPARENT SOME IMMEDIATE RANKINGS OF 
POD1000000047_S0000123	WHAT IS PREFERABLE AND NOT PREFERABLE MIGHT BECOME APPARENT UM AND OTHERWISE UM YOU UM UM WE MIGHT NEED TO FALL BACK AND THINK ON ON BROADER STRATEGIES FOR MAKING DECISIONS IN THE FACE OF 
POD1000000047_S0000124	WHAT WE CALL DEEPER UNCERTAINTY NOW THIS IS A DEEPLY CONTESTED AREA AND WHEN GOVERNMENTS MAKE POLICIES AH VERY OFTEN THEY'RE IN THESE SITUATIONS WHERE THEY THEY CAN'T EVEN THINK OF ALL THE THINGS THAT MIGHT HAPPEN SO THE THEY'RE IN THE SITUATION OF DEEPER UNCERTAINTY 
POD1000000047_S0000125	AND PEOPLE HAVE TESTED VARIOUS WAYS TO GO ABOUT IT THE FIRST THING IS TO NOT TO THINK THAT YOU CAN OPTIMIZE YOU CAN'T BE PERFECT YOU YOU CANNOT BE PERFECT SO THERE ARE SORT OF SUGGESTIONS OF PEOPLE MAKE IN TERMS OF GENERAL DECISION-MAKING IN THESE CONTEXTS 
POD1000000047_S0000126	SO TO DO WITH FLEXIBILITY AND RESILIENCE SO YOU WANT TO BE YOU WANT YOU DON'T WANT TO COMMIT YOURSELF TO SOMETHING YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO CHANGE BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PREDICT EVERYTHING THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN SO YOU BUILD IN FLEXIBILITY AND ADAPTIVITY TO YOUR DECISION 
POD1000000047_S0000127	AND THAT'S THE SAME IN ANY BUSINESS ANY GOVERNMENT ANY ANY PROJECT AT ALL THE OTHER THING IS BUILDING RESILIENCE IN WHICH YOU ARE ARE ESSENTIALLY CAN COPE WITH THE UNEXPECTED AND THINGS AND THAT MEANS BOTH AND YOU KNOW THE POSSIBILITY OF REALLY GOOD THINGS HAPPENING 
POD1000000047_S0000128	AS WELL AS THE POSSIBILITY OF REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPENING THAT YOU ARE MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVEN'T PUT ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE BASKET ESSENTIALLY SO IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETELY GONE UP A TOTAL BLIND ALLEY THAT YOU CAN'T RENEGOTIATE 
POD1000000047_S0000129	WHICH MEANS OPERATING FROM A BASIS AH MOST ROBUST BASIS AS POSSIBLE SO IT MEANS NOT TRYING TO OPTIMIZE THE SINGLE PATH BUT BUILDING IN ROBUSTNESS WHICH MEANS YEAH UM I THINK IN IN TERMS OF CAREER OF COURSE BUILDING IN 
POD1000000047_S0000130	TRANSFERABLE SKILLS YOU'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO USE IN A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES SO I THINK THESE ARE STANDARD TACTICS TO RESPOND TO DEEPER UNCERTAINTY AND WHICH CAN BE USED IN ANY IN ANY SITUATION 
POD1000000047_S0000132	YEAH THAT'S DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT THE ORGANIZATION EIGHT THOUSAND HOURS TO ADVISE PEOPLE ON YOU KNOW HOW TO HAVE A BIG IMPACT WITH A CAREER IS REALLY FOCUS ON IS SPECIALLY EARLY IN YOUR CAREER LIKE KEEP YOUR OPTIONS OPEN CHOOSE THINGS THAT ARE ROBUST UNDER YOU KNOW IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT POSSIBLE THINGS HAPPENING 
POD1000000047_S0000134	ONE OTHER QUESTION THAT WE FIND WE COME UP AGAINST A FAIR AMOUNT IN THINKING ABOUT CAREERS AND CHARITIES AND ALL KINDS OF THINGS IS YOU KNOW HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT CHOOSING BETWEEN A SMALL CHANCE OF SOME REALLY HUGE OUTCOME LIKE YOU KNOW SAVING THE WORLD FROM A PANDEMIC THAT KILLS MILLIONS 
POD1000000047_S0000136	AGAINST SOME HIGH PROBABILITY OF A VERY MODERATE OR A MORE MODERATE OUTCOME SOONER HELPING PEOPLE IN YOUR LIKE OF COMMUNITY UM THIS SEEMS LIKE A VERY DIFFICULT THING TO DEAL WITH DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS ON HOW PEOPLE CAN GO ABOUT MAKING THESE KINDS OF DECISIONS 
POD1000000047_S0000137	YEAH VERY DIFFICULT BUT AGAIN THESE ARE COMMON DECISIONS IN OUR IN ALWAYS IN OUR LIVES DO WE GO FOR THE HIGH RISK OPTION OR OR THE SAFER OR THE SAFER OPTION AND I I PERSONALLY THINK THAT 
POD1000000047_S0000138	ACTUALLY A A MIXED STRATEGY IS SOMETHING THAT BUSINESSES I THINK WOULD RECOMMEND ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO I'M NOT INVOLVED IN IN ANY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BUT OFTEN WHEN I THINK PEOPLE TAKE AH AN IDEA OF PORTFOLIO 
POD1000000047_S0000139	OF AH AH AH RISK TAKING BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL RISKS YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE WITH ANYTHING THAT YOU DO AND THESE ARE ALL RISKS AND SO YOU THAT MIGHT HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT INVESTED IN RATHER SAFE THINGS WITH A SAFE RETURN YOU'RE PRETTY SURE 
POD1000000047_S0000140	THAT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS GOING TO HAVE A REASONABLE RETURN AND THAT YOU REALLY CAN PREDICT THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE USING YOUR CAREER OR YOUR MONEY FOR WHAT YOU'RE GETTING FOR AH ON THE OTHER HAND ON MORE SPECULATIVE 
POD1000000047_S0000141	AH YOU YOU MIGHT BE SUPPORTING SOMETHING THAT ACTUALLY MIGHT NOT COME TO NOW COME TO ANYTHING EITHER BECAUSE THE SOLUTION IT'S PROMISING 
POD1000000047_S0000142	AND WON'T WORK OR THE THREAT WON'T ARISE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO UM I I I THINK ACTUALLY A MIXED STRATEGY IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AGAIN YOU KNOW I WOULDN'T WANT TO JUST PUT ALL THE EGGS IN ONE BASKET SO IT'S JUST 
POD1000000047_S0000144	THAT WOULDN'T BE APPROPRIATE I ALSO PERSONALLY FEEL THAT UM THAT THIS IS COMPLETELY MY PERSONAL REACTION THAT I GIVE IS THAT UM I I QUITE LIKE A MIXED STRATEGY IN WHICH SOME OF THINGS ARE AH THE THE BIGGER 
POD1000000047_S0000146	SLIGHTLY ANONYMOUS 
POD1000000047_S0000147	TRYING TO WHERE YOU YOU'RE ALL GIVING MONEY 
POD1000000047_S0000149	LARGE ORGANIZATION IS DOING SOMETHING WHICH UM IS CONTRIBUTING IN A PRO PROBABLY FAIRLY PREDICTABLE WAY TO TO TO UM UM IMPROVING THINGS WITH PEOPLE VERSUS YOU KNOW THE MORE PERSONAL ONES WHERE YOU DO HAVE THE PERSONAL 
POD1000000047_S0000150	CONTACT AND AND YOU MIGHT GET SLIGHTLY MORE SOME EMOTIONAL FEEDBACK FROM THEM PARTLY BECAUSE THEY MIGHT ENCOURAGE YOU TO PERHAPS TAKE ON A MORE AH AH THE FEEDBACK FROM THE ALTRUISM MIGHT ENCOURAGE YOU TO TAKE ON A BIGGER AFTER ALL 
POD1000000047_S0000151	A A BIGGER COMMITMENT TO THE FUTURE 
POD1000000047_S0000153	SO THERE ARE VARIOUS WAY OF THINKING ABOUT HOW TO QUANTIFY THE RISKS OF POSSIBLE GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ACTIVITY CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT A MICRO MODE OR A MICRO LIFE IS 
POD1000000047_S0000154	OH YEAH YEAH THESE ARE UNITS THAT WELL I INVENTED THE MICRO LIFE SOMEONE ELSE INVENTED THE MICROMORT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST A WAY OF TRYING TO GET A COMMON SCALE FOR YOU KNOW PARTICULARLY BECAUSE A MICROMORT IS ACUTE RISKS THINGS THAT MIGHT KILL YOU ON THE SPOT BUT OTHERWISE YOU'RE HEALTHY 
POD1000000047_S0000155	AND IT'S A ONE IN A MILLION CHANCE OF DYING BECAUSE OF AN ACTION YOU MIGHT TAKE SO SKYDIVING OR SOMETHING IS APPROXIMATELY SEVEN TO TEN MICROMORTS AND AND THEN MICRO LIFE WHICH IS SOMETHING TO DO WITH CHRONIC RISKS WHICH IS THE RISK OF 
POD1000000047_S0000156	UM I THINK WE CAN START ON QUITE INTERESTING WHICH IS AH BAD LIFESTYLE YEAH LACK OF EXERCISE OR SMOKING OR DRINKING OR AND YEAH BAD DIET WHATEVER AH WHICH ISN'T GONNA KILL YOU ON THE SPOT UM BUT 
POD1000000047_S0000157	WILL AH SHORT HIS LIFE LIKELY TO SHORTEN YOUR LIFE DEFINITELY NOT DEFINITELY AT ALL UM MAYBE NOT BUT PROBABLY WILL AND SO IT'S A REDUCTION OF HALF AN HOUR IN THE LIFE EXPECTANCY I FIND THESE QUITE USEFUL BECAUSE IT ENABLES YOU TO COMPARE ALL THESE DIFFERENT 
POD1000000047_S0000158	THINGS LIKE DIET AND SMOKING AND AH EXERCISE AND THINGS LIKE AND AND MAKES ME FOR EXAMPLE BUT YOU KNOW SMOKING IS WHERE YOU YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST RETURN OR THE BIGGEST YOU KNOW UM IN TERMS OF NOT SMOKING BUT THE HUGE BIGGEST RETURN AND AH 
POD1000000047_S0000160	DRINKING AT LOW DOSES WELL ACTUALLY IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE 
POD1000000047_S0000162	HUGE A HUGE CONCERN UNLESS YOU'RE REALLY SWIGGING IT DOWN UM BUT EXERCISE AGAIN I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND AND DIET'S IMPORTANT AND AND 
POD1000000047_S0000163	IT IT JUST GIVES YOU A FEELING OF WHAT'S YOU KNOW WHERE THE UM YOU KNOW WHERE THE PRIORITIES ARE WHICH OF COURSE IT'S ALL A BIT OBVIOUS THAT THE PRIORITIES THAT PEOPLE DO IN PUBLIC HEALTH BUT IT MAKES YOU SLIGHTLY UNCONCERNED ABOUT UM OTHER THINGS THAT PEOPLE MIGHT BE REALLY CONCERNED 
POD1000000047_S0000165	SO THESE THESE CONCEPT WERE INVENTED TO HELP PEOPLE GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING AND MAKE BETTER DECISIONS DO YOU THINK THAT WE COULD INVENT AH NEW CONCEPTS TO HELP AH PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HOW THEY CAN DO MORE GOOD IN THE WORLD 
POD1000000047_S0000167	YEAH AH AH YOU KNOW A MICROALTRUE 
POD1000000047_S0000169	IT'S DIFFICULT I MEAN THE QALY IS A START IS A GOOD ONE IF YOU'RE REALLY IF YOU'RE IF YOUR AREA OF CAUSE IS IS TO DO WITH SAVING LIVES AND IMPROVING HEALTH AND LETHAL RISK TO THE PEOPLE THEN QALY'S IS A GOOD ONE IT'S ALREADY ESTABLISHED YOU CAN LOOK AT HOW MANY 
POD1000000047_S0000171	SO HOW MANY YEARS OF LIFE ARE YOU GONNA GAIN FOR AND FROM YOUR INTERVENTION AND AND AND WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GIVING MONEY FOR TO SOME PARTICULAR CHARITIES 
POD1000000047_S0000173	PROMOTE 
POD1000000047_S0000174	YOU KNOW THEY'RE EXTREMELY COST EFFECTIVE IN THAT WAY 
POD1000000047_S0000175	IT'S MORE DIFFICULT IF YOU HAVE THE BROADER IDEA FOR EXAMPLE OF OF OF SUPPORTING EDUCATION OF OF PRESERVING THE ENVIRONMENT ACTUAL ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON QUITE HARD TO PUT A A NUMBER ON THAT UM WITHIN A WITHIN A PARTICULAR AREA CAUSE 
POD1000000047_S0000176	AH CAUSE THEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO IT BUT PROVIDE HAVING METRICS THAT 
POD1000000047_S0000178	GO RIGHT ACROSS DIFFERENT AREAS 
POD1000000047_S0000180	IS IS DIFFICULT AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE CRITICIZE THAT 
POD1000000047_S0000182	ATTEMPTS TO DO 
POD1000000047_S0000183	I STILL THINK IT'S WORTH TRYING TO DO I MEAN AND PEOPLE STRUGGLING TO DO THIS WITHIN 
POD1000000047_S0000185	WITHIN THE WITHIN ENVIRONMENT AND SO ON I DON'T THINK I'VE GOT ANY GREAT IDEA TO BE HONEST UM TO AH I MEAN ONE POSSIBILITY OF COURSE IS 
POD1000000047_S0000186	IS LOOKING AT WITH GENERAL MEASURES OF WELL-BEING WHICH AGAIN PEOPLE ARE DOING IT'S MEASURED BY NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS NOW TO TRY TO MEASURE WELL-BEING UM IN TERMS OF HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THE ABOUT THEY'RE LIVES AND AND 
POD1000000047_S0000187	SO GENERAL WELL-BEING INDICES WHICH ARE NOT JUST I MEAN YOU KNOW HEALTH RELATED OR LENGTH OF LIFE RELATED AND I THINK AH HAVE GOT HAVE GOT GREAT POTENTIAL BUT IT'S NOT GONNA RIGHT YOU'RE NOT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET THE PERFECT MEASURE ON THEM 
POD1000000047_S0000188	SO PEOPLE ARE OFTEN ASKED YOU KNOW HOW WOULD YOU RATE AH HOW GOOD YOUR LIFE IS GOING FROM AH ONE TO TEN YOU KNOW TYPICALLY THEY GIVE ANSWERS BETWEEN SIX AND EIGHT AT LEAST IN THE U K 
POD1000000047_S0000189	MAYBE WE COULD HAVE A MICRO HAPPY WHICH SHOULD BE SOMETHING AS GOOD AS MOVING SOMEONE FROM SIX TO SEVEN OR SEVEN TO EIGHT ON THIS WELFARE SCALE 
POD1000000047_S0000190	YEAH YEAH YEAH NO I'M YES YEAH YEAH EXACTLY AH AH AH I THINK THAT NO THE SCALES UM WELL ACTUALLY I FIND THEM VERY REVEALING WHEN PEOPLE DO MEASURE THEM PARTICULAR CROSS CULTURE AS YOU SAID 
POD1000000047_S0000192	EVERYONE SAYS SEVEN 
POD1000000047_S0000194	MAYBE CAUSE I LIKE NUMBER SEVEN BUT IT ALSO REFLEXES THIS IDEA WHY IT'S NOT BAD AH YOU KNOW 
POD1000000047_S0000195	MUSTN'T GRUMBLE 
POD1000000047_S0000197	YOU KNOW COULD BE BETTER BUT MUSTN'T GRUMBLE YOU KNOW SO SLIGHTLY BRITISH STOIC ATTITUDE SO UM I THINK IT'S ALMOST PREDICTABLE WHAT PEOPLE ARE GONNA RESPOND BUT I FIND FOR EXAMPLE THE AGE DISTRIBUTION OF THESE RESPONSES AND HOW THE AGE DISTRIBUTION VARIES ACROSS CULTURES 
POD1000000047_S0000198	EXTREMELY INTERESTING AND UM THE IDEA OF UM YOU KNOW WHETHER ONE COULD MOVE 
POD1000000047_S0000200	YOU KNOW AH GROUPS OF PEOPLE AH ON THAT SCALE AND WOULD BE VERY IMPORTANT AND WHEN I THINK OF LITTLE CHARITIES AND SOME OF THE ONES I I I GIVE TO THE YOU KNOW 
POD1000000047_S0000201	WHICH ARE ARE NOT DIRECTLY I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD ACTUALLY MAKE PEOPLE LIVE LONGER BUT UM YOU'D HOPE TO WOULD IMPROVE PEOPLE'S WELL-BEING AND SENSE OF HAPPINESS AND CONSIDERABLY 
POD1000000047_S0000202	YEAH IT IS A FASCINATING AREA OF A RESEARCH AND AND THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL DIFFERENCES SO I THINK IN THE U K AND AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA PEOPLE DO TEND TO GIVE SEVEN OR MAYBE EIGHT IF THEY'RE FEELING PARTICULARLY GOOD BUT IN SOUTH AMERICA PEOPLE ARE JUST FOR SOME REASON MORE EXUBERANT 
POD1000000047_S0000203	AND AH TEND TO OFTEN GIVE EIGHTS AH EVEN EVEN WHEN THEY'RE RELATIVELY POOR AH BUT BY CONTRAST IN AH EASTERN EUROPE AND EASTERN ASIA LIKE JAPAN AND CHINA PEOPLE TEND TO GIVE RELATIVELY LOW SCORES RELATIVE TO HOW LIFE THEY WELL SEEMS TO SEEMS TO BE GOING FROM THE OUTSIDE 
POD1000000047_S0000204	YEAH YEAH YEAH NO NO PEOPLE IN DIFFERENT CULTURES I THINK IN AFRICA THEY'RE EVEN LOWER PEOPLE ARE VERY 
POD1000000047_S0000206	YEAH THERE ARE SOME COUNTRIES THAT WHERE THE AVERAGE IS AS LOW AS FOUR OUT OF TEN WHICH MAY MAYBE HALF OF PEOPLE ARE GIVING LESS THAN FOUR WHICH IS AH A BIT UNFORTUNATE 
POD1000000047_S0000207	FOR THE GAIN I MEAN THESE ARE I THEY ARE THEY'RE VERY CULTURALLY AND I THINK SPECIFIC AND SO AND BUT I THINK WHAT I WANT TO SEE IS RELATIVE CHANGES RELATIVE CHANGES PERHAPS YOU KNOW COMPARED WITH 
POD1000000047_S0000208	THE AVERAGE IN THAT IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT ONE WOULD FOR YOU AND UM YOU CAN'T JUST GET EVERYONE UP TO EIGHT OR WHATEVER I MEAN THERE ARE VERY DIFFERENT CULTURAL ATTITUDES TO DO WITH I THINK THAT ARE REFLECTED IN THOSE QUESTIONS 
POD1000000047_S0000209	YEAH SO BY TRYING TO ESTIMATE RISKS OR THE SIZE OF PROBLEMS IN THIS QUANTITATIVE WAY DO YOU THINK WE RISK BEING BIASED AGAINST APPROACHES THAT ARE HARDER TO QUANTIFY 
POD1000000047_S0000210	YEAH I THINK IT ALWAYS IS A PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE START BELIEVING YOU KNOW THAT THE MODEL THE MEASURE WHICH IS A ONLY A VERY INADEQUATE THING STARTS TRYING TO STARTS BECOMING THE THING THAT YOU ARE IN FACT THEN TRYING TO UM YOU KNOW YOU'RE FOCUSED ON 
POD1000000047_S0000211	TO THE DETRIMENT OF ALL OTHERS YOU MEAN AND AND THERE'S A REAL PROBLEM WITH OVER YOU KNOW METRICIZING AN ANY ACTIVITY YOU KNOW PRETENDING THAT YOU CAN MEASURE THE BENEFITS OF EVERYTHING 
POD1000000047_S0000213	ACADEMIC WORLD OF COURSE IS A AND 
POD1000000047_S0000214	REAL EXAMPLE OF THAT WHERE PEOPLE START GETTING OBSESSED WITH IMPACT FACTORS AND NONSENSE LIKE THAT SO AND THERE'S A AH AH REAL DANGER WITH WITH UM BELIEVING THESE THINGS TOO MUCH AND ALSO IN TIME 
POD1000000047_S0000215	I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE A DAMN GOOD GO AT TRYING TO DO IT AND JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS IS DIFFICULT AND CANNOT BE DONE PERFECTLY DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU CAN'T AT LEAST HAVE A HAVE A STAB AT IT BECAUSE BECAUSE YOU MAY 
POD1000000047_S0000217	YOU KNOW OFTEN 
POD1000000047_S0000218	THESE THINGS MIGHT CAN GET REALLY CLEAR AROUND THINGS YOU KNOW THE GREAT PRECISION MIGHT NOT BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THAT ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT AN NOT AN EFFECTIVE USE OF THE SOURCES COMPARED WITH INCIDENCES 
POD1000000047_S0000220	YEAH AND I THINK THAT RATHER THAN GIVING US A PERFECT ANSWER TO ALL QUESTIONS USING YOU KNOW MODELS AND LOOKING AT DIFFERENT FACTORS CAN AS YOU SAY JUST HELP YOU TO IDENTIFY LIKE CLEAR DIFFERENCES OR AREAS WHERE YOU NEED TO GET MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE YOU JUST HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO FACTOR THAT IN ALL 
POD1000000047_S0000221	SO I MUST SAY IT CAN DEFINITELY BE VERY USEFUL UM FINALLY JUST TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON CAN BENEFIT FROM A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF STATISTICS LEARNING MORE STATISTICS YOU KNOW EITHER IN THEIR EVERYDAY LIVES OR IN BEING MORE EFFECTIVE AS ALTRUISTS 
POD1000000047_S0000222	UM AND TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK I GUESS RELATING BACK TO THE PAST QUESTION IT COULD POTENTIALLY LIMIT US 
POD1000000047_S0000224	YEAH I THINK I THINK UM YEAH OF COURSE I DO OF COURSE I'D SAY THIS WOULDN'T I UM BUT YEAH I DO BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE WOULD BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEM A GREATER IDEA OF STATS AND MEASUREMENT AND NUMBER AND QUANTITY 
POD1000000047_S0000225	AND AND THE FRAILTIES OF THAT AS WELL BECAUSE THE POINT ABOUT UNDERSTANDING STATISTICS IS BOTH UNDERSTANDING THEIR STRENGTH AND THEIR WEAKNESSES THE TWO ARE ABSOLUTELY HAND IN HAND AND WHAT PEOPLE TEND TO DO AT THE MOMENT THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW I SUPPOSE NOT CONFIDENT 
POD1000000047_S0000226	WITH WITH WITH NUMBERS AND HOW THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THEIR WHOLE ARE ALWAYS CONSTRUCTED SOMEONE HAS CHOSEN WHAT TO MEASURE AND THE THERE IS THEY TEND TO EITHER ACCEPT THEM AS IF THEY'RE GOD GIVEN TRUTH AND THAT'S YOU KNOW THE NUMBER AND THAT'S SO VITAL 
POD1000000047_S0000227	FOR YOU AND THAT IS IT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR OR REJECT THEM OUT OF HAND OH YOU CAN'T PUT NUMBERS 
POD1000000047_S0000229	DAMN LIES AND STATISTICS AND THIS IS NONSENSE AND THOSE TWO EXTREME VIEWS BOTH EQUALLY IDIOTIC 
POD1000000047_S0000231	BUT IF YOU'VE GOT A SLIGHTLY MORE NUANCED VIEW YOU'LL REALIZE THAT STATISTICS NUMBERS AND MEASUREMENT ARE AN INCREDIBLY VALUABLE TOOL BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST A TOOL AND THEY THEY HAVE THEIR FRAILTIES AND INADEQUACIES SO AH THEY BOTH NEED TO BE 
POD1000000047_S0000233	TEACH AND UNDERSTAND THE STRENGTH AND THE LIMITATIONS AND WHAT I MEAN I'M INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF EDUCATIONAL PROJECTS IN IN WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO DO JUST THAT 
POD1000000047_S0000235	SO IT'S AH REALLY A MATTER OF TRYING TO AH ASSIGN THE APPROPRIATE WEIGHT TO EACH DIFFERENT KIND OF EVIDENCE OR EACH DIFFERENT PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT COMES YOUR WAY 
POD1000000047_S0000236	I THINK I MEAN IN THE END WHAT STATISTICS IS IS TO DO WITH ITS QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE THAT'S WHAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT THAT THE TALKING ABOUT AND AND EVIDENCE CAN BE GOOD OR BAD OR YOU KNOW A LONG WHOLE SCALE IT'S NOT A TRUE OR FALSE 
POD1000000047_S0000237	UM IT'S JUST EVIDENCE AND WE ARE TRYING TO WEIGH UP OUR EVIDENCE AND WHICH WE DO ALL THE TIME IN OUR LIVES WE DO THIS BUT YOU KNOW OUR GUTS TEND TO BE AH BIT FALLIBLE WHEN IT COMES TO WEIGHING UP EVIDENCE 
POD1000000047_S0000239	TOO INFLUENCED BY CERTAIN SALIENT THINGS THAT WOULD ATTRACT OUR ATTENTION AND SO AS SHE'S STANDING BACK AND TRYING TO BE A BIT COOLER ABOUT WEIGHING UP EVIDENCE I THINK IT'S A REALLY VALUABLE AH THING TO TRY TO DO IN ALL AREAS OF LIFE IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT 
POD1000000047_S0000240	YEAH ABSOLUTELY WHICH IS NOT TO SAY THAT YOU SHOULD COMPLETELY DISCOUNT THAT GUT FEELING BUT OFTEN JUST SUPPLEMENT IT WITH SOME EXTRA EVIDENCE SOURCE STATISTICS 
POD1000000047_S0000241	LIKE MY GUTS 
POD1000000047_S0000243	I I DON'T TRUST THEM A BIT BUT I STILL YOU KNOW GO WITH THEM 
POD1000000047_S0000244	YEAH I THINK THAT'S ABOUT ALL WE'VE GOT TIME FOR NOW BUT THANKS SO MUCH DAVID UM THIS HAS BEEN VERY INFORMATIVE UM REALLY INTERESTING

POD1000000048_S0000009	AH SO IN BOTH CAPACITIES I AM AH INTERESTED IN WHAT SORTS OF METHODS WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THINKING ABOUT A I IN A RIGOROUS WAY AND PARTICULARLY THE UNCERTAINTY OF POSSIBLE FUTURES SURROUNDING A I 
POD1000000048_S0000010	AH AND I HAVE A FEW MORE SPECIFIC INTERESTS SUCH AS OPENNESS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE RISKS RELATED TO BAD ACTORS 
POD1000000048_S0000011	OKAY UM SO ARE YOU TRYING TO PREDICT WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND WHEN AND WHAT SORT OF EFFECTS IT WILL HAVE 
POD1000000048_S0000012	AH SO NOT NECESSARILY PREDICT PER SE BUT AT LEAST UNDERSTAND WHAT'S PLAUSIBLE I THINK THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WITH ANY AH HIGH CONFIDENCE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND WHEN 
POD1000000048_S0000013	BUT UNDERSTANDING FOR EXAMPLE WHAT SORTS OF AH ACTIONS PEOPLE COULD CARRY OUT WITH A I SYSTEMS TODAY OR IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE IN DIFFERENT DOMAINS LIKE CYBER SECURITY AH AH 
POD1000000048_S0000014	AND INFORMATION OPERATIONS AH THE PRODUCTION OF FAKE NEWS AUTOMATICALLY AND AUTONOMOUS DRONES AND SO FORTH 
POD1000000048_S0000015	I THINK UNDERSTANDING THE SECURITY LANDSCAPE OF THOSE SORTS OF THINGS DOESN'T NECESSARILY REQUIRE A VERY DETAILED FORECAST OF WHEN EXACTLY AH SOMETHING WILL OCCUR SO MUCH AS UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE AH GIVEN NEAR TERM TRENDS 
POD1000000048_S0000017	AH YEAH YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO SAY THIS IS WHEN THE AH THIS PARTICULAR ACCIDENT OR MALICIOUS BEHAVIOR WILL OCCUR BUT JUST AH THAT THESE ARE THE SORTS OF RISKS THAT WE NEED TO BE PREPARED FOR 
POD1000000048_S0000018	RIGHT RIGHT DOES THAT BRING YOU INTO CONTACT WITH AH WITH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE DEVELOPING A I'S LIKE LIKE GOOGLE 
POD1000000048_S0000020	YEAH YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THOSE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE AN INTEREST IN AH MAKING SURE THAT A I IS AH AS BENEFICIAL AS POSSIBLE 
POD1000000048_S0000022	KEENLY AWARE OF THE FACT THAT THEY CAN BE MISUSED AND THAT THERE MIGHT BE AH ACCIDENT RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THEM 
POD1000000048_S0000023	SO FOR EXAMPLE I HELD A WORKSHOP AH FAIRLY RECENTLY ON THE AH CONNECTION BETWEEN BAD ACTORS AND A I AND AH WHAT SORTS OF BAD ACTORS WE MIGHT BE CONCERNED ABOUT IN THIS SPACE AND WE HAD SOME PARTICIPATION FROM SOME OF THOSE GROUPS 
POD1000000048_S0000024	RIGHT RIGHT WHAT KINDS OF BAD ACTORS ARE YOU THINKING OF 
POD1000000048_S0000025	AH I THINK THERE AH YOU CAN LOOK AT IT FROM A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES SO DEPENDING ON THE DOMAIN THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AH YOU MIGHT END UP WITH DIFFERENT SORTS OF ACTORS 
POD1000000048_S0000026	SO IN THE CASE OF AH PHYSICAL HARM ASSOCIATED WITH A I YOU MIGHT LOOK AT AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS AH AND THE WEAPONIZATION OF CONSUMER DRONES AND IN THAT CASE IT'S SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE PARTICULARLY APPEALING TO STATE ACTORS AS WELL AS TERRORISTS 
POD1000000048_S0000027	WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE WEAPONIZATION OF CONSUMER DRONES THOUGH WITHOUT MUCH AUTONOMY IF ANY IN THE CASE OF ISIS OVERSEAS 
POD1000000048_S0000028	SO AH THERE ARE CASES LIKE THAT WHERE WE CAN FORESEE THAT PARTICULAR AH GROUPS WHEN GIVEN MORE ADVANCED CAPABILITIES SUCH AS AH HIGHER BASELINE LEVELS OF AUTONOMY IN CONSUMER DRONES 
POD1000000048_S0000029	AH WOULD LIKE AH WOULD WOULD BE ABLE TO AND WOULD LIKE TO CARRY OUT AH DAMAGE ON A LARGER SCALE 
POD1000000048_S0000030	AH BUT IN OTHER CASES IT'S LESS CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE AH THERE ARE CONCERNS AROUND MASS SURVEILLANCE AND IT'S OFTEN NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHETHER ONE SHOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT AH STATES OR CORPORATIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000031	AH DEPENDING ON WHAT SORTS OF RISK YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT FOR EXAMPLE UM CORPORATIONS AH CURRENTLY HAVE A LOT OF DATA ON PEOPLE AND 
POD1000000048_S0000032	THERE'S THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF CONCERNS RAISED ABOUT AH THE USE OF A I TO MAKE DECISIONS THAT HAVE CRITICAL IMPACTS ON PEOPLE'S LIVES 
POD1000000048_S0000033	SUCH AS DENYING LOANS AH AND AH IN COURT DECISIONS AND SO FORTH AH THAT ARE BEING INFORMED BY OFTEN NOT VERY TRANSPARENT ALGORITHMS 
POD1000000048_S0000034	SO THOSE THOSE ARE SOME CONCERNS BUT THERE'S ALSO A POTENTIALLY DIFFERENT CLASS OF CONCERNS AROUND AH AH AUTHORITARIAN STATES USING A I FOR AH OPPRESSION 
POD1000000048_S0000035	SO IT'S AH I THINK THERE'S A RANGE OF RISKS BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING AH THERE'S GOING TO BE A STUDY INCREASE IN THE FLOOR OF THE SKILL LEVEL AS THESE AH A I TECHNOLOGIES DIFFUSE 
POD1000000048_S0000036	THAT IS THERE WILL BE MORE AND MORE AH CAPABILITIES AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCALE THAT IS INDIVIDUALS AS WELL AS PEOPLE WITH MORE ACCESS TO COMPUTING POWER AH MONEY AND DATA AT THE HIGHER END 
POD1000000048_S0000037	SO AH IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR HOW TO THINK ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ON THE ONE HAND YOU MIGHT EXPECT THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000038	AH THE THE BIGGEST ACTORS ARE THE MOST CONCERNING BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MOST AH SKILL AND AH RESOURCES BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THEY ALSO ARE SOMETIMES IN THE CASE OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS 
POD1000000048_S0000039	AH HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO CITIZENS AND IN THE CASE OF CORPORATIONS HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO STAKEHOLDERS YOU MIGHT ALSO THINK THAT YOU WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT INDIVIDUAL AH ROGUE ACTORS 
POD1000000048_S0000040	SO AH AH THAT'S AN ISSUE I'M STILL TRYING TO THINK THROUGH IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REPORT THAT I'M WRITING BASED ON THAT WORKSHOP 
POD1000000048_S0000041	RIGHT SINCE PEOPLE OFTEN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN AH THE SHORT TERM AH RISKS FROM A I LIKE SELF DRIVING CARS NOT WORKING PROPERLY OR ALGORITHMIC BIAS 
POD1000000048_S0000042	AND THEN THE LONGER TERM CONCERNS OF WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO ONCE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS AH AS SMART AS HUMANS OR POTENTIALLY AH MUCH MUCH MORE INTELLIGENT WHICH ONE OF THOSE DO YOU SPEND MORE TIME WORKING ON 
POD1000000048_S0000043	I TRY TO FOCUS ON ISSUES THAT AH SPAN DIFFERENT TIME HORIZONS SO I THINK THAT A I AND SECURITY IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALREADY SEEING SOME EARLY INSTANCES OF TODAY 
POD1000000048_S0000044	SO IT'S ALREADY BEING USED FOR DETECTION OF AH CYBER THREATS FOR EXAMPLE AND THE PRODUCTION OF VULNERABILITIES IN SOFTWARE THERE'S A LOT OF AH RESEARCH GOING ON 
POD1000000048_S0000045	WHICH AN EXAMPLE BEING THE DARPA GRANT CYBER AH CYBER GRANT CHALLENGE RECENTLY WHERE THERE'S AUTOMATED HACKING AH AND AUTOMATED DEFENSE 
POD1000000048_S0000046	AH SO THERE'S ALREADY STUFF HAPPENING ON THE FRONT OF A I AND SECURITY AS WELL AS THE ECONOMICS OF A I AND SO AND AH ISSUES SURROUNDING PRIVACY 
POD1000000048_S0000047	BUT AH IT'S IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHETHER THE ISSUES IN THE FUTURE WILL JUST BE AH STRAIGHTFORWARD EXTENSIONS OF THOSE OR WHETHER THERE WILL BE QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT 
POD1000000048_S0000049	THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY AH AND IMAGINE HOW IT MIGHT PROGRESSIVELY DEVELOP INTO A MORE EXTREME FUTURE AS WELL AS TO THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCONTINUITIES WHEN A I AH PROGRESSES MORE QUICKLY 
POD1000000048_S0000050	RIGHT RIGHT SO I SHOULD SAY THIS POINT UM THAT AH WE HAVE A PROFILE UP ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT THE UM THE THE POTENTIAL UPSIDES AND DOWNSIDES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE SO WE GO THROUGH AH ALL ALL OF THE BASICS 
POD1000000048_S0000051	AND MILES YOU HAVE A FORTHCOMING GUIDE TO AH WORK ON A I POLICY AND STRATEGY THAT AH WE'RE GONNA LINK TO SO HERE WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GO BEYOND THAT IF YOU FIND YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED THEN POTENTIALLY JUST GO ON TO READ ONE OF THOSE UM ONE OF THOSE DOCUMENTS FIRST 
POD1000000048_S0000052	UM SO OH WHICH POLICY OR STRATEGY QUESTIONS DO YOU SEE AS MOST IMPORTANT FOR US TO ANSWER IN ORDER TO ENSURE UM THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE GOES WELL RATHER THAN IN A IN A BAD WAY 
POD1000000048_S0000053	I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND SOME OF THE ONES SAY WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER SURROUNDING SECURITY AND AND PREVENTING THE UM WEAPONIZATION OF A I BY AH DANGEROUS ACTORS IS ONE 
POD1000000048_S0000054	BUT ONE AH AND ALSO OTHER ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN WIDELY DISCUSSED IN THE MEDIA AND BY ACADEMICS SUCH AS ACCOUNTABILITY OF ALGORITHMS TRANSPARENCY AH THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF A I AND SO FORTH 
POD1000000048_S0000055	AH BUT ONE THAT I THINK IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT PARTICULARLY OVER THE LONG AH OVER THE LONG TERM AH THIS IS A CASE WHERE THERE MIGHT BE A NEED TO THINK ABOUT POSSIBLE DISCONTINUITIES 
POD1000000048_S0000056	IS COORDINATION SURROUNDING A I SAFETY SO THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION CALLED TO A I SAFETY IN THE PAST FEW YEARS AH AND THERE'S STARTING TO BE A LOT OF AH CONCRETE AND SUCCESSFUL RESEARCH ON THE PROBLEM OF AVOIDING CERTAIN A I SAFETY FAILURE MODES 
POD1000000048_S0000057	LIKE WIRE HEADING AND VALUE MISALIGNMENT AND SO FORTH AH BUT THERE'S BEEN LESS ATTENTION PAID TO HOW DO YOU ACTUALLY AH INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO ACT ON THE THE BEST PRACTICES AND THE GOOD THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS THAT ARE DEVELOPED 
POD1000000048_S0000058	ASSUMING THAT THEY WILL BE DEVELOPED AND THAT'S A A POTENTIALLY BIG PROBLEM IF THERE'S A COMPETITIVE SITUATION BETWEEN COMPANIES OR BETWEEN COUNTRIES OR BOTH AND THERE'S AN INCENTIVE TO SKIMP ON THOSE SAFETY MEASURES 
POD1000000048_S0000059	SO THERE'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF WORK FOR EXAMPLE AH BY ARMSTRONG ET AL AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AH LOOKING AT AH ARMS RACE TYPE SCENARIOS INVOLVING A I WHERE THERE WOULD BE AN INCENTIVE TO SKIMP 
POD1000000048_S0000060	BECAUSE YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING THE LEAD AH IN AN A I RACE AND THERE MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT AH WE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE EXTENT WILL BE 
POD1000000048_S0000061	BUT THERE IT MIGHT TURN OUT THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT TRADE OFFS BETWEEN SAFETY AND PERFORMANCE OF A I SYSTEMS SO AH ONE MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO IN ORDER TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE WHETHER ECONOMIC OR MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE WISE AH 
POD1000000048_S0000062	RAMP UP THE CAPABILITIES OF AN A I SYSTEM BY ADDING MORE HARDWARE ADDING MORE DATA ADDING MORE SENSORS AND EFFECTORS AND SO FORTH UM BUT THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY BE DANGEROUS IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE THE FULL AH BEHAVIORAL ENVELOPE OF THE SYSTEM 
POD1000000048_S0000063	SO TO SPEAK AND HOW TO CONSTRAIN ACTORS THE HUMAN ACTORS FROM DOING THAT AH IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM 
POD1000000048_S0000064	SO I'VE AH I ALONG WITH OTHERS AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AND OTHER DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS HAVE STARTED THINKING ABOUT AH WHAT IS AN INCENTIVE COMPATIBLE MECHANISM TO ENSURE 
POD1000000048_S0000065	AH THE PEOPLE DO THE RIGHT THING IN THAT CASE THAT IS TO SAY WE DON'T WANT TO ASK PEOPLE TO DO SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY AGAINST THEIR INTERESTS 
POD1000000048_S0000066	IF THEY ACTUALLY DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING THESE SYSTEMS AND PROTECTING THEMSELVES MILITARILY OR OTHERWISE AH BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE CONSTRAINED IN SOME SORT OF WAY 
POD1000000048_S0000067	SO ONE EXAMPLE WOULD BE AH AT A RANGE THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY FOR A FULLY FLESHED OUT EXAMPLE BUT JUST TO ILLUSTRATE THE SORT OF THING I'M TALKING ABOUT 
POD1000000048_S0000068	WOULD BE SOME SORT OF ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN A I DEVELOPERS SUCH THAT AH IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO THE LATEST BREAKTHROUGHS OR THE LATEST COMPUTING POWER 
POD1000000048_S0000069	AH YOU WOULD NEED TO SUBMIT TO SOME SORT OF AH SAFETY MONITORING AND AND AH ADHERE TO CERTAIN BEST PRACTICES 
POD1000000048_S0000070	AH THAT WOULD CREATE AN INCENTIVE IF YOU WANT TO BE ON THE CUTTING EDGE TO AH TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE AH SAFETY PROTOCOLS SO AH THAT'S AGAIN THAT'S NOT A FULLY WORKED OUT EXAMPLE 
POD1000000048_S0000071	THAT'S THAT'S AN EXAMPLE OF THE CLASS OF THINGS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE OF THE DEVELOPING SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FOR HOW TO ENSURE THAT THE RIGHT THING AH THAT'S BEING DEVELOPED ON THE TECHNICAL FRONT ACTUALLY GETS IMPLEMENTED 
POD1000000048_S0000072	RIGHT AH DO YOU LOOK MUCH AT SAY WHAT GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE DOING IN THIS AREA WHETHER THERE'S REGULATIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE PUTTING IN PLACE OR AT LEAST PREPARING TO PUT IN PLACE IN FUTURE 
POD1000000048_S0000073	YEAH SO I THINK THAT THAT TIES IN WITH WHAT I WAS SAYING A LITTLE BIT IN THAT ONE MIGHT ENVISION THAT AH AS A I CAPABILITIES DEVELOP 
POD1000000048_S0000074	IT'LL BE INCREASINGLY SEEN AS AH A MATTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY THAT A COUNTRY BE ON THE THE LEADING EDGE I THINK IT'S A IT'S NOT SUPER CLEAR HOW TO NAVIGATE THAT YET AH 
POD1000000048_S0000075	I THINK THERE'S SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT CLEARLY IN MY OPINION IT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL FOR COUNTRIES TO HAVE SOME EXPERTS IN HOUSE IN THEIR GOVERNMENTS WHO ACTUALLY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT A I 
POD1000000048_S0000076	AND ARE ABLE TO DEAL WITH CRISES AS THEY ARISE IF THEY ARISE AH AND TO BE ABLE TO THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF AH AH A I ON THE LABOR FORCE FOR EXAMPLE 
POD1000000048_S0000077	AH SO I THINK THERE'S SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT AND SOME POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED FOR DEALING WITH SOME OF THE NEAR TERM ISSUES BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM ISSUES 
POD1000000048_S0000078	IT'S NOT SUPER CLEAR THAT WE WANT TO RUSH INTO A SITUATION WHERE GOVERNMENTS ARE ARE LEADING THIS IF IF THAT WOULD TURN OUT TO AH ONLY ACCENTUATE THE THE ARMS RACE DYNAMICS 
POD1000000048_S0000079	WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO AVOID AH IF A I IS SEEN EVEN MORE AS A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE IN AN UNHARMED UNHELPFUL WAY 
POD1000000048_S0000080	SO I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT ON THOSE WHO ARE THINKING ABOUT THE LONG TERM POLICY ISSUES AROUND A I TO DEVELOP A MORE POSITIVE PROPOSAL THAT INVOLVES NOT JUST 
POD1000000048_S0000081	AH YOU KNOW THE U S GOVERNMENT GETTING INVOLVED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ACCELERATING AH AMERICAN A I CAPABILITIES 
POD1000000048_S0000082	BUT SOME MORE COLLABORATIVE APPROACH 
POD1000000048_S0000083	YEAH I SUPPOSE WITH WITH PREVIOUS DANGEROUS TECHNOLOGIES LIKE LIKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS OR CHEMICAL OR BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS THERE'S THERE'S BEEN AGREEMENTS TO TRY TO UM SLOW DOWN THEIR DEVELOPMENT AND AND DEPLOYMENT IS THAT SOMETHING THAT COULD POTENTIALLY HAPPEN HERE AT THE INTERNATIONAL LEVEL 
POD1000000048_S0000085	I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE SOME SORT OF SLOWING DOWN AMONG A SMALL NUMBER OF ACTORS 
POD1000000048_S0000086	AWE'RE FORTUNATE THAT THERE IS A AH HIGH CONCENTRATION OF AH COMPUTING POWER AND TALENT AND SKILL IN A FAIRLY SMALL NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000087	SO THERE'S PRETTY MUCH NO CHANCE OF SOME RANDOM PERSON AH OUT COMPETING AH YOU KNOW THE TOP ORGANIZATIONS IN A I AH IN A SURPRISING WAY 
POD1000000048_S0000088	AH SO IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WITH WITH SOME OF THE TOP COMPANIES AND NONPROFITS AS WELL AH COUNTRIES THEY COULD COORDINATE IN SOME SORT OF WAY 
POD1000000048_S0000089	AH NOT TO POSTPONE A I YOU KNOW ACROSS SOCIETY FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME BUT AT LEAST TO BE CAUTIOUS AH IN THE LATER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT AND TO ALLOW TIME FOR AH MUTUAL VETTING OF OF SAFETY PROCEDURES AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000090	SO I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE SOME SORT OF COORDINATION BUT AH THE THE TECHNICAL AND THE POLITICAL FACTORS INTERACT TO A LARGE EXTENT 
POD1000000048_S0000091	BUT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE GOOD SAFETY MEASURES THAT ARE EFFICIENT AND THAT DON'T INTRODUCE A LOT OF OVERHEAD AH COMPUTATIONAL OR OTHERWISE AH INTO THESE SYSTEMS 
POD1000000048_S0000092	THEN WE'LL BE IN A BETTER PLACE TO ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO COORDINATE BECAUSE IT WON'T BE IMPOSING A LOT OF COSTS ON THEM AND LIKEWISE TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE ABLE TO COORDINATE BETTER 
POD1000000048_S0000093	IT WILL AH WE'LL BE IN A BETTER POSITION ACTUALLY GET PEOPLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS AH THIS AH MECHANISMS IF THEY DO IMPOSE SOME PERFORMANCE PENALTIES 
POD1000000048_S0000094	RIGHT SO SO CAN YOU THINK OF UM AH LIKE ANY MAJOR BITS OF PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON A I STRATEGY QUESTIONS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS 
POD1000000048_S0000095	SO THE EXAMPLE I MENTIONED OF AH THE PAPER BY ARMSTRONG ET AL AH CALLED RACING TO THE PRECIPICE IS ONE EXAMPLE AND IT PRESENTED SORT OF A STARK VERSION OF THE ARMS RACE SCENARIO 
POD1000000048_S0000096	THAT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE REASONS TO BE OUR MORE OPTIMISTIC THAN AH THAN ARE PRESENTED IN THAT PAPER AH BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT ONLY A CERTAIN AH IN A SET OF ASSUMPTIONS AS WITH ANY AH MODEL 
POD1000000048_S0000097	BUT AH MORE GENERALLY I THINK THERE'S BEEN PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRINCIPLES AND CRITERIA FOR GOOD POLICIES IN RECENT YEARS SO FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE ASILOMAR AH CONFERENCE AND THE SET OF ASILOMAR A I PRINCIPLES 
POD1000000048_S0000098	SO I THINK THAT WAS A GOOD STEP TOWARDS DEVELOPING SOME SHARED UNDERSTANDING AROUND AH THE NEED TO AVOID ARMS RACES AND AH CONCERNS OVER A I WEAPONIZATION AND SO FORTH 
POD1000000048_S0000099	UM BUT AH IT'S I I STILL THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR 
POD1000000048_S0000100	AH PROGRESS TO BE MADE SO AH THERE WAS A PAPER PUT OUT BY THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AH BY NICK BOSTROM CARRICK FLYNN AND AH ALLAN DEFOE RECENTLY THAT AH LOOKS AT POLICY DESIDERATA FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MACHINE SUPERINTELLIGENCE 
POD1000000048_S0000101	AND THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD MATERIAL THERE BUT I THINK AH THEY WOULD BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT THAT AH WE'RE STILL AT THE THE THE HIGH LEVEL PRINCIPLES STAGE OF DEVELOPING THESE POLICIES 
POD1000000048_S0000102	SO WE WE HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE WANT TO AVOID THAN AH THAN WE DID A FEW YEARS AGO AND WHAT SORT OF WHAT WHAT A AH GOOD POLICY PROPOSAL WOULD LOOK LIKE 
POD1000000048_S0000103	BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE ANYTHING AH SUPER ACTIONABLE SO I THINK THE SITUATION IS A BIT ANALOGOUS TO WHERE A I SAFETY WAS A FEW YEARS AGO 
POD1000000048_S0000104	WHERE THERE WERE AH THERE WAS STARTING TO BE AN ARTICULATION OF WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS AH WITH AH THE BOOK SUPER INTELLIGENCE AND VARIOUS OTHER PUBLICATIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000105	AND PEOPLE WERE STARTING TO TAKE THE PROBLEM SERIOUSLY AND STARTED TO HAVE A VOCABULARY FOR WHAT A WHAT A SOLUTION WOULD LOOK LIKE WITH AH VALUE ALIGNMENT AH AND OTHER TERMS BEING COINED 
POD1000000048_S0000106	AH BUT THERE WASN'T YET ANY YOU KNOW CONCRETE AH RESEARCH AGENDA AND YEAH SUBSEQUENTLY THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF AH CONCRETE RESEARCH AGENDAS 
POD1000000048_S0000107	AS WELL AS TECHNICAL PROGRESS ON SOME PARTS OF THOSE RESEARCH AGENDAS AH WITH WORK BY OPENAI AND DEEPMIND AND OTHERS AH LEADING THE WAY 
POD1000000048_S0000108	SO I THINK THAT WE'RE POTENTIALLY IN A SIMILARLY EXCITING PHASE ON THE A I POLICY FRONT WHERE WE HAVE A A DECENT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS AH AND WITH THE EXAMPLE OF AVOIDING ARMS RACES AH BEING YOU KNOW FOREFRONT IN MY MIND 
POD1000000048_S0000109	AT LEAST BUT WE DON'T YET HAVE A CONCRETE AH WE DON'T HAVE YOU KNOW CLEAR MODELS AND AH CASE STUDIES THAT WE CAN POINT TO AS AS WAYS FORWARD 
POD1000000048_S0000110	SO I THINK THAT'S THE NEXT STEP IS MOVING INTO MORE CONCRETE PROPOSALS AND AH TRYING TO BALANCE SOME OF THE TRADE OFFS THAT HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN RECENT PAPERS 
POD1000000048_S0000112	SO IT SEEMS LIKE EXCUSE ME SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF THE LATEST THINKING IN THIS AREA UM ISN'T WRITTEN UP IN PUBLIC YET PARTLY BECAUSE AH PEOPLE DON'T WANT TO PUBLICIZE THEIR VIEWS AT THIS POINT OR JUST BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME TO GET PAPERS PUBLISHED 
POD1000000048_S0000113	AH WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE BEST WAY FOR SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN WORKING IN THE AREA TO GET UP TO SPEED ON THE ISSUES 
POD1000000048_S0000114	SO I THINK UM AGAIN IT'S SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE SITUATION WITH UM AH YOU KNOW A I SAFETY A FEW YEARS AGO AND I THINK THE BOOK SUPERINTELLIGENCE WAS A BIG STEP FORWARD ON THAT FRONT IN TERMS OF HAVING A SINGLE REFERENCE TO POINT PEOPLE TO 
POD1000000048_S0000115	BUT AH IT'S LESS CLEAR IF THERE'S ONE SINGLE REFERENCE TO POINT PEOPLE TO ON AH A I POLICY ISSUES THOUGH I'M HOPING HOPING THAT THE CAREER GUIDE THAT I'M WORKING ON WILL BE SOMEWHAT USEFUL IN THAT REGARD 
POD1000000048_S0000116	ANOTHER RESOURCE THAT COMES TO MIND IS A SYLLABUS FOR A CLASS ON THE GLOBAL POLITICS OF A I DEVELOPED BY AH ALLAN DAFOE AT YIELD AND THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE 
POD1000000048_S0000117	THAT THAT'S A VERY DETAILED UM LIST OF RESOURCES AH AND I I AH I'M SURE THERE'LL BE A LINK PROVIDED AH FOR FOR AH THIS INTERVIEW SOMEWHERE AH 
POD1000000048_S0000118	YEAH 
POD1000000048_S0000119	AND YEAH SO I I THINK THAT'S THAT'S ANOTHER SET OF RESOURCES IT'S ESSENTIALLY A LONG LIST OF UM AH YOU KNOW BOTH FORMAL AH YOU KNOW ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS AS WELL AS THINGS IN THE MORE GRAY LITERATURE 
POD1000000048_S0000120	AH SUCH AS BLOG POSTS WHICH AH IS YOU KNOW I THINK THE SORT OF THING THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO YOU KNOW AS THINGS THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY WRITTEN UP ACADEMICALLY BUT ARE YOU KNOW SOMEWHAT ACCESSIBLE BUT EVEN THERE THERE'S STILL SOME THINGS LIKE AH YOU KNOW GOOGLE DOCS THAT ARE USED INTERNALLY AND SO FORTH 
POD1000000048_S0000121	SO I THINK IF IF BASED ON READING THOSE SORTS OF THINGS THIS IS CLEARLY SOMETHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEN AH THE OBVIOUS NEXT STEP IS JUST TO GET IN TOUCH WITH PEOPLE AH WHO ARE WORKING ON THESE ISSUES AND AND ASK AND YOU KNOW INDICATE WHAT YOUR INTERESTS ARE 
POD1000000048_S0000122	AND THERE MIGHT BE AH THINGS THAT AREN'T AVAILABLE ONLINE THAT THEY CAN POINT YOU TO 
POD1000000048_S0000123	YEAH YOU MENTIONED THE ASILOMAR STATEMENT OF OF PRINCIPLES AH DO YOU JUST WANT TO DESCRIBE THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000124	SURE AH SO 
POD1000000048_S0000125	TWO YEARS AGO THERE WAS A CONFERENCE ON BENEFICIAL A I HELD IN PUERTO RICO AND THAT LED TO AN OPEN AN OPEN LETTER ON A I 
POD1000000048_S0000126	AH AND SUBSEQUENTLY SOME INVESTMENT BY ELON MUSK IN THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE AH WHICH SUPPORTED A LOT OF GRANTS IN THIS SPACE 
POD1000000048_S0000127	AH AND I THINK THAT THAT LED TO A LOT OF ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE AND THERE WERE YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE BY INCLUDING A LOT OF A I SCIENTISTS WHO SIGNED ONTO THAT AH LETTER 
POD1000000048_S0000128	AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY THE ASILOMAR PRINCIPLES AH WHICH WERE DEVELOPED AT A CONFERENCE TWO YEARS LATER AH THIS YEAR AH AT ASILOMAR IN CALIFORNIA 
POD1000000048_S0000129	DEVELOPED A MORE AH SPECIFIC SET OF PROPOSALS FOR WHAT SORTS OF AH THINGS A I SCIENTISTS SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT SO NOT JUST YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT THERE SHOULD BE MORE RESEARCH BUT ALSO AH THINGS LIKE CAPABILITY CAUTION 
POD1000000048_S0000130	SO BEING ATTENTIVE TO AH THE FACT THAT WE DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE UPPER LIMITS OF A I CAPABILITIES WILL AH WILL ULTIMATELY BE 
POD1000000048_S0000131	AND THE THINGS I MENTIONED ABOUT AVOIDING ARMS RACES AND AH BEING CONCERNED ABOUT AH A I WEAPONIZATION MORE BROADLY SO AH I THINK THAT'S A GOOD EXAMPLE OF DEVELOPING AH YOU KNOW SORT OF A CONSENSUS VIEW ON WHAT 
POD1000000048_S0000132	AH WHAT WE WANT TO SEE AND WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE WE WANT TO SEE A I BENEFITING SOCIETY AS A WHOLE AND WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IT YOU KNOW AH LEADING TO THE ACCRUING OF BENEFITS TO A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE OR TO AH LARGE SCALE WAR OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000133	UM AND AH I THINK IT'S IT'S ENCOURAGING TO SEE NOT JUST THAT BUT ALSO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER SETS OF PRINCIPLES AH THROUGH THE IEEE AND THEIR AH EFFORT ON ETHICALLY ALIGNED AH A I DESIGN 
POD1000000048_S0000134	SO SO I READ THIS THIS PRINCIPLES AND THEY SEEM QUITE STRONG ON PAPER AH DO YOU DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THEM 
POD1000000048_S0000135	AH I THINK I THINK THERE'S SOMEWHAT OF A GAP BETWEEN THE LEVEL OF ABSTRACTION AH OF OF THE PRINCIPLES AND CONCRETE AH STEPS THAT PEOPLE CAN TAKE 
POD1000000048_S0000136	SO FOR EXAMPLE IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR WHAT ANY INDIVIDUAL AH CAN DO TO STOP AN ARMS RACE FOR EXAMPLE BUT AH I THINK IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO KNOW WHERE WHERE YOU'RE HEADED 
POD1000000048_S0000137	AND THEN AH FIGURING OUT EXACTLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT THAT IS IS THE NEXT STEP 
POD1000000048_S0000138	YEAH SO AH IN IN YOUR GUIDE YOU SUGGEST THAT PEOPLE COULD POTENTIALLY WORK ON A I STRATEGY AND POLICY QUESTIONS AT PLACES LIKE GOOGLE DEEPMIND OR OPENAI WHERE WHERE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IS ACTUALLY BEING AH DEVELOPED 
POD1000000048_S0000139	UM WHAT WHAT CONCRETELY COULD YOU SEE PEOPLE DOING AT PLACES LIKE THAT IF THEY TOOK A JOB THERE 
POD1000000048_S0000140	YEAH SO SO SOME EXTENT PEOPLE AT THOSE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE DOING SOMETHING FAIRLY SIMILAR TO WHAT I AND MY COLLEAGUES ARE DOING AH IN ACADEMIA 
POD1000000048_S0000141	WHICH IS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THE PROBLEMS ARE AND TRYING TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS AH I THINK THE THE BENEFIT OF BEING ON THAT SIDE OF THINGS IS TO AH HAVE MORE DIRECT EXPOSURE TO WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND SO TO SPEAK 
POD1000000048_S0000142	AH IN A I DEVELOPMENT AND I THINK THAT CAN BE USEFUL AH FOR DEVELOPING A SET OF WHAT SORTS OF PROBLEMS ARE ACTUALLY CROPPING UP AH AS A RESULT OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF CAPABILITIES THAT ACTUALLY EXIST AS OPPOSED TO JUST ONES IN THE FUTURE 
POD1000000048_S0000143	THOUGH I THINK IT'S ALSO NOTABLE THAT AH PEOPLE AT THESE ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN VERY ACTIVE IN THE EFFORTS THAT I'VE MENTIONED SUCH AS AH RAISING ATTENTION TO A I SAFETY 
POD1000000048_S0000144	WHICH WAS AN INITIATIVE AH THAT THAT INVOLVED PEOPLE AT GOOGLE BRAIN AND OPENAI AND THE CONCRETE PROBLEMS IN THE A I SAFETY PAPER 
POD1000000048_S0000145	AH AND PEOPLE AT DEEPMIND HAVE BEEN VERY AH INFLUENTIAL IN IN CALLING FOR MORE A I SAFETY WORK AND THEY'VE BEEN PUBLISHING AH FAIRLY EARLY ON THIS MATTER RELATIVE TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000146	SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF AH REASON TO THINK THAT THESE ORGANIZATIONS ARE ARE PLAYING A POSITIVE ROLE AND I THINK IT'S IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO BE INVOLVED IN AH SORT OF THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ON THESE TOPICS 
POD1000000048_S0000147	AS WELL AS DOING AH DIRECT RESEARCH 
POD1000000048_S0000149	AND HOW HARD IT IS TO GET A JOB AT A PLACE LIKE THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000151	I WOULD IMAGINE THEY NOT ONLY HAVE A FEW PEOPLE WORKING ON A I STRATEGY OR POLICY ARE THESE EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE ROLES 
POD1000000048_S0000152	I WOULD SAY THEY'RE PRETTY COMPETITIVE AH AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW A GENERAL PHENOMENON IN ANYTHING RELATED TO A I THESE DAYS WHETHER ON THE AH POLICY SIDE OR THE TECHNICAL SIDE 
POD1000000048_S0000153	UM BUT I I THINK THAT THIS IS A GROWTH AREA FOR SURE SO AH IF IF ONE DEVELOPS EXPERTISE IN THIS TOPIC AH AND HAS SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE 
POD1000000048_S0000154	THEN I THINK THERE WILL ULTIMATELY BE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE AH TO YOU IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
POD1000000048_S0000155	IT'S AGAIN I I WANNA YOU KNOW DRAW AN ANALOGY TO A I SAFETY WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONCERN ABOUT WILL THERE BE JOBS IN A I SAFETY AH YOU KNOW THREE YEARS YEARS AGO AND I THINK THAT DETERRED SOME GRAD STUDENTS FROM WORKING IN THIS SPACE AND 
POD1000000048_S0000156	NOW AH THE SITUATION SEEMS TO LOOK A BIT BETTER IN THAT THERE'S A FAIR NUMBER OF ADVERTISEMENTS FOR POSTDOCS AND AH PEOPLE BEING HIRED AT TOP AH TOP LABS TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES 
POD1000000048_S0000157	SO I THINK WE'LL PROBABLY SEE SOMETHING PRETTY SIMILAR AH NOT NECESSARILY BECOMING NOT COMPETITIVE BUT AH THEY'RE BEING A LITTLE BIT OF AH SLACKENING OVER TIME AS AS THERE'S A NEED FOR DEVELOPING LARGER TEAMS TO WORK ON THESE TOPICS 
POD1000000048_S0000159	AND ANOTHER PATH YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT IS GOING INTO AH POLITICS OR POLICY ROLES FOR EXAMPLE AS A CONGRESSIONAL STAFFER OR PERHAPS AT A THINK TANK LIKE THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTE OR THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OR POTENTIALLY JUST GOING INTO PARTY POLITICS IN GENERAL 
POD1000000048_S0000160	AH WHAT USEFUL THINGS DO YOU ENVISAGE PEOPLE COULD DO THERE 
POD1000000048_S0000162	YEAH SO I THINK IN THE SAME WAY THAT WORKING AT AN A I LAB WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S AH PRACTICAL ON THE TECHNICAL FRONT 
POD1000000048_S0000163	AH WORKING FOR CONGRESS OR PARLIAMENT OR AH YOU KNOW POLITICAL PARTY WOULD GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT'S PRACTICAL ON THE POLITICAL FRONT 
POD1000000048_S0000164	SO AH IN ADDITION TO THAT DEVELOPING A BETTER INTUITION FOR THE THE SYSTEM THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH AND WHAT THE CONSTRAINTS ARE 
POD1000000048_S0000165	I THINK IT'S ALSO POTENTIALLY A GOOD WAY TO ACTUALLY INFLUENCE WHAT WHAT'S ACTUALLY DONE BY THOSE BODIES 
POD1000000048_S0000166	SO FOR EXAMPLE AH IN AH THE U S CONGRESS RIGHT NOW THERE WAS JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AN A I CAUCUS AH TO ORGANIZE THE DISCUSSION OF AH MEMBERS OF CONGRESS ON ISSUES RELATED TO A I 
POD1000000048_S0000167	WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON ISSUES AH RELATED TO THE FUTURE OF WORK BUT I THINK OVER TIME WE'LL SEE MORE AH DISCUSSION OF OF THE LONGER TERM SORTS OF ISSUES 
POD1000000048_S0000168	AH THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT IN IN THOSE FORA AND THEY WOULD BE USEFUL TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE RIGHT THING IS AH IS ULTIMATELY DONE WORKING IN THOSE PLACES 
POD1000000048_S0000169	AND ABLE TO ACTUALLY ACT ON THE BEST AH THE BEST CURRENT UNDERSTANDING DEVELOPED BY RESEARCHERS AND BY PRACTITIONERS 
POD1000000048_S0000170	YEAH SO I THINK A BIG RISK OF GOING INTO AH POLITICS OR POLICY IN GENERAL WOULD BE THAT YOUR CAREER PROGRESSES BUT YOU'RE NOT SPECIFICALLY IN ONE OF THE PLACES THAT ENDS UP AH HAVING A SAY IN HOW THESE THINGS GO 
POD1000000048_S0000171	UM YOU JUST END UP YOU KNOW BEING A YOU KNOW WORKING IN A IN IN A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE THAT THAT TURNS OUT NOT TO BE THAT RELEVANT AH ARE THERE ANY ROLES THAT THAT YOU CAN TAKE EARLY ON OR WHAT CAN YOU DO TO POSITION YOURSELF WELL SO THAT YOU DON'T JUST GET SIDELINED IN THE END 
POD1000000048_S0000173	I THINK IF YOU INTEND TO WORK IN POLITICS THEN YOU HAVE TO BE SOMEWHAT OPPORTUNISTIC ABOUT AH JOBS AND THE EBB AND FLOW OF POLITICAL OPPORTUNITIES SO AH FOR EXAMPLE 
POD1000000048_S0000174	UM IF YOU KNOW ONE ONE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE IS DECLINING IN ITS RELEVANCE AH IN IN TERMS OF A I THEN ONE SHOULD CONSIDER ABOUT AH YOU KNOW JUMPING SHIP TOWARDS SOMEWHERE THAT'S MORE RELEVANT 
POD1000000048_S0000175	AH SO I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW AH TAKING ONE PARTICULAR JOB WILL LOCK YOU IN FOREVER AH BUT BUILDING UP SOME AH POLITICAL CAPITAL AND AH SOME AH HUMAN CAPITAL IN THAT AREA COULD BE USEFUL 
POD1000000048_S0000176	AH EVEN IF YOU ULTIMATELY WANT TO SWITCH TO A DIFFERENT ORGANIZATION BUT I WOULD PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE IDEA OF UM YOU KNOW NOT BEING RELEVANT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT AT THE UNDECIDED OF THE PEOPLE 
POD1000000048_S0000177	AH YOU'RE NOT AT THE AT THE ORGANIZATION WHERE PEOPLE ARE DEVELOPING THE LATEST A I AS I AS I MENTIONED BEFORE I THINK THAT'S A VERY EXCITING OPPORTUNITY AH AND YOU KNOW ALONG WITH ACADEMIA IT'S IT'S A GREAT GREAT PLACE TO WORK ON THESE ISSUES 
POD1000000048_S0000178	BUT GOVERNMENTS STILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN AH FRAMING THESE ISSUES AND IN CONVENING DISCUSSIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000179	FOR EXAMPLE OF AH EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE THE PREPARING FOR THE FUTURE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE REPORT PUT OUT BY THE WHITE HOUSE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY LAST YEAR 
POD1000000048_S0000180	AH WHICH AH YOU KNOW WAS WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR WORKSHOPS THAT BROUGHT TOGETHER AH EXPERTS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF AREAS IN LAW AND ECONOMICS AH AND A I TECHNOLOGY AND SAFETY 
POD1000000048_S0000181	AND SO I THINK AH YOU STILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO FRAME THE DISCUSSION AND MOVE THE BALL FORWARD EVEN IF AH YOU'RE NOT AH WORKING IN THE LATEST LABS 
POD1000000048_S0000182	YEAH SO WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THE BEST PLACES TO APPLY TO IN THAT AREA 
POD1000000048_S0000183	SO IT'S IT'S A BIT TRICKY TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL IT DEPENDS ON AH FACTORS LIKE WHAT YOUR CITIZENSHIP IS AND AH WHAT PARTICULAR POLICY ISSUES YOU'RE INTERESTED IN 
POD1000000048_S0000184	BUT SOME AH FAIRLY ROBUST AH RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD BE TO AH LOOK FOR AH FOR FOR FOR A PARTICULAR CLASS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS 
POD1000000048_S0000185	ONE AREA TO LOOK AT WOULD BE TRIPLE A S FELLOWSHIPS SO AH THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE HAS A AH FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM 
POD1000000048_S0000186	WHERE THEY ESSENTIALLY PUT PEOPLE IN AH ROTATIONS IN ORGANIZATIONS LIKE CONGRESS AND AH THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH WHERE THEY CAN AH IMPLEMENT SOME OF AH SOME THEY CAN YOU KNOW DRAW ON THEIR TECHNICAL EXPERIENCE 
POD1000000048_S0000187	SOME SOMEONE WITH A BACKGROUND IN A I WOULD PROBABLY END UP IN AN A I RELEVANT ORGANIZATION SO I HAVE HEARD A LOT OF GOOD THINGS ABOUT THAT BEING A GOOD GOOD WAY TO DEVELOP CAREER CAPITAL AND EXPERIENCE AND UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE POLITICAL SYSTEM WORKS 
POD1000000048_S0000188	AH BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY YOU KNOW GOING TO RESULT IN BEING IN THE EXACT RIGHT LOCATION FOR AH FOR YOU KNOW SOLVING A I POLICY PROBLEMS THE NEXT FEW MONTHS 
POD1000000048_S0000189	I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY WHERE WHERE THAT WOULD BE AH OR EVEN IF THERE IS SUCH A PLACE BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE STILL 
POD1000000048_S0000190	DESPITE ALL THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE IN A RELATIVELY EARLY STAGE SO AH THERE ISN'T EVEN YET A RECOMMENDATION AH THERE ISN'T EVEN YET A NOMINATION FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE OFFICE OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY IN THE WHITE HOUSE 
POD1000000048_S0000191	SO AH OTHERWISE I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IS A GOOD PLACE TO TO GO UM SO AH LIKEWISE WE DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THE AGENDA OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS ON THE A I FRONT 
POD1000000048_S0000192	AH AND THERE'S A LOT OF UM THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION BUT NOT MUCH AH INSTITUTION BUILDING AH IN IN GOVERNMENTS AT THE MOMENT SO AH IT'S HARD FOR ME TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL 
POD1000000048_S0000193	BUT I THINK GETTING EXPERIENCE IS A PRETTY ROBUST THING TO DO 
POD1000000048_S0000194	RIGHT RIGHT UM SO SITUATION THAT I I ENCOUNTER REASONABLY OFTEN IS I MEET SOMEONE WHO'S REALLY SMART WHO IS VERY INTERESTED IN THIS TOPIC WHO MIGHT BE ABLE TO MAKE A GREAT CONTRIBUTION 
POD1000000048_S0000195	BUT AT THE MOMENT UM THERE AREN'T THAT MANY GROUPS THAT ARE HIRING FOR THESE ROLES AH YOU'RE AT THE FUTURE OF HUMANITY INSTITUTE AND I GUESS THERE'S ALSO THE FUTURE OF LIFE INSTITUTE UM BUT THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PLACES THAT SOMEONE AH CAN POTENTIALLY APPLY 
POD1000000048_S0000196	UM SOMETHING WHAT ADVICE SHOULD I GIVE SOMEONE IN THAT SITUATION SHOULD THEY SHOULD THEY CONTINUE STUDYING PERHAPS OR BUILDING EXPERTISE SO THAT THEY'RE IN A BETTER POSITION TO TO APPLY IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE NUMBER OF POSITIONS GROWS OR UM YEAH 
POD1000000048_S0000197	UM YEAH I MEAN AGAIN IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT IN GENERAL IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WHAT 
POD1000000048_S0000198	BACKGROUND THE PERSON HAS AND WHAT WHAT SORTS OF JOBS THEY'RE INTERESTED IN BUT I THINK AH IF ONE CASTS A FAIRLY LARGE NET IN TERMS OF WHAT A I ISSUES ONE WANTS TO WORK ON THERE THERE'S A FAIRLY AH FAIRLY LARGE RANGE OF ORGANIZATIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000199	IT'S NOT JUST AH IT'S NOT JUST F H I THERE'S ALSO AH THE CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF EXISTENTIAL RISK AH THE LEVERHULME CENTER FOR THE FUTURE OF INTELLIGENCE THE TECH POLICY LAB AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON 
POD1000000048_S0000200	AH AND YOU KNOW VARIOUS FACULTY PROGRAMS AROUND THE AH AH VARIOUS ACADEMIC PROGRAMS AROUND THE COUNTRY IN THE U S AND AROUND THE WORLD ARE ARE LOOKING TO HIRE PEOPLE 
POD1000000048_S0000201	FOR EXAMPLE AS POSTDOCS OR A FACULTY MEMBER IN IN AREAS RELATED TO A I AND POLICY IF IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WITH AN ACADEMIC BACKGROUND 
POD1000000048_S0000202	AND THERE ARE PROBABLY A FAIR NUMBER OF AH POLICY POSITIONS AT AH TECH COMPANIES THAT AREN'T NECESSARILY SPECIFIC TO A I BUT THAT WOULD LEAD TO GETTING VALUABLE EXPERIENCE AH IN THE BROAD AREA OF TECH POLICY 
POD1000000048_S0000203	SO UM AGAIN TO GENERALIZE A BIT I WOULD RECOMMEND CASTING A FAIRLY LARGE NET AND WORKING IN ADJACENT AREAS IF YOU CAN'T IMMEDIATELY WORK IN THE EXACT RIGHT PLACE 
POD1000000048_S0000204	AH BECAUSE THIS IS NOT SOME NOT THE SORT OF AREA WHERE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON A I POLICY FOR DECADES AND IT'S HARD TO BREAK IN FOR THAT REASON IT'S MORE JUST AH THAT IT'S STILL A FIELD THAT'S GROWING 
POD1000000048_S0000205	AND I DON'T THINK THAT THAT GROWTH WILL STOP I THINK THERE WILL BE MORE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE BUT IF IF YOU CAN'T FIND THE RIGHT OPPORTUNITY NOW 
POD1000000048_S0000206	THEN AH THEN YOU KNOW TALK TO PEOPLE AH IN THE FIELD ABOUT WHAT SORTS OF OPPORTUNITIES ARE ON THE HORIZON AND TRY AND WORK IN ADJACENT FIELDS THAT MIGHT BE ONE THING TO CONSIDER 
POD1000000048_S0000207	YEAH SO WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES FOR SOMEONE STARTING OUT TRYING TO START A CAREER IN THIS AREA 
POD1000000048_S0000208	AH DEPENDING ON ONE'S BACKGROUND I THINK THE MAIN CHALLENGE WOULD BE AH AH BONING UP ON AREAS OF WEAKNESS 
POD1000000048_S0000209	SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU HAVE A POLICY BACKGROUND YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS ON AH LEARNING MORE ABOUT A I AH AND IF YOU HAVE A TECHNICAL BACKGROUND YOU MIGHT WANT TO FOCUS MORE ON LEARNING ABOUT POLICY 
POD1000000048_S0000210	UM I I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES AH CHALENGES IS WHAT YOU MENTIONED BEFORE ABOUT THERE NOT BEING A SUPER AH CLEARLY ACCESSIBLE LITERATURE ON THE TOPIC 
POD1000000048_S0000211	AND I I THINK THERE'S SOME EFFORT BEING AH GOING INTO ADDRESSING THAT WITH THE CAREER GUIDE AND THE BIBLIOGRAPHY THAT I MENTIONED 
POD1000000048_S0000212	UM BUT I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT THERE'S AH YOU KNOW ANY SPECIFIC SET OF PITFALLS THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND 
POD1000000048_S0000213	PEOPLE AVOID BESIDES YOU KNOW AH NOT UM YOU KNOW NEGLECTING THE THE AREAS IN WHICH AH THEY'RE WEAK DON'T DON'T TRY AND REST ON YOUR LAURELS IN SAY TECHNICAL AREAS OR POLICY AREAS BECAUSE IT'S A FAIRLY INTERDISCIPLINARY AH AREA 
POD1000000048_S0000214	AND YOU WOULD NEED TO AH THINK ABOUT UM WHAT SORTS OF DISCIPLINARY PERSPECTIVES WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SOLVING THE PROBLEM YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AND NOT JUST AH WHAT IS YOUR BACKGROUND THOUGH OF COURSE YOU WANT TO DRAW ON YOUR STRENGTHS 
POD1000000048_S0000215	UM I GUESS IT'S A IT'S A FIELD THAT IS IN IT'S FAIRLY EARLY STAGES AND IS IS GROWING QUICKLY 
POD1000000048_S0000216	AH IT IT'D BE A GOOD FIT FOR SOMEONE WHO WAS REALLY ABLE TO SET THEIR OWN DIRECTION AND MEET PEOPLE AND POTENTIALLY ATTRACT FUNDING TO DO WHAT THEY WANT TO DO SOMEONE WHO'S GONNA CREATE THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEY WANT TO GO INTO 
POD1000000048_S0000217	YEAH ABSOLUTELY AND I YEAH IT'S IT'S AN AREA THAT'S EVOLVING AND I THINK A LOT AH A LOT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000218	THAT EXIST TODAY AH AND I HAVE MENTIONED AS AS YOU KNOW GOOD PLACES TO WORK AND SO FORTH DIDN'T EXIST FIVE YEARS AGO SO YEAH 
POD1000000048_S0000220	YEAH SOME OF THEM DIDN'T EXIST ONE YEAR AGO SO AH IT'S IT'S AN AREA IN FLUX AND I THINK YOU AS WITH POLITICS 
POD1000000048_S0000221	YOU SHOULD BE OPPORTUNISTIC THINK ABOUT THINKING YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT UM WHAT WHAT'S SORT OF UM YEAH WHAT WHAT'S THE RIGHT PLACE FOR YOU TO BE IN 
POD1000000048_S0000222	UM BUT YEAH I THINK IT'S IT'S A VERY EXCITING AREA TO WORK IN AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT AH YOU KNOW IT'S AN AREA THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM THEIR THEIR BACKGROUND 
POD1000000048_S0000223	UN SO IF YOU HAD SOMEONE THAT COULD GO INTO ANY ORGANIZATION OR ROLE AND THAT'D BE A GOOD FIT WHAT WHAT KIND OF AH PERSON WOULD YOU THINK IS MOST VALUABLE OUT OF EVERYTHING 
POD1000000048_S0000225	MOST VALUABLE PERSON I DON'T REALLY HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000226	YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000227	YEAH 
POD1000000048_S0000228	IS THERE ANY IS THERE ANY AH SAY VACANCY OUT THERE THAT YOU THINK YOU KNOW YOU JUST WISH THAT SOMEONE SOMEONE COULD FILL IT 
POD1000000048_S0000229	UM 
POD1000000048_S0000231	ANY ONE AH ONE ONE VACANCY THAT THAT COMES TO MIND IS AH FOR THE POLICY RESEARCHER POSITION AT DEEPMIND SO THEY'RE CURRENTLY HIRING FOR FOR SOMEONE TO SPECIFICALLY LOOK AT A I POLICY 
POD1000000048_S0000232	SO I THINK THE THE THE CASE IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO WORK AND A GOOD ROLE TO HAVE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN INFLUENCING THE CONVERSATION AROUND A I POLICY AND BEING EXPOSED TO THE LATEST DEVELOPMENTS 
POD1000000048_S0000233	SO AH YEAH IF YOU'RE IF YOU'D BE A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR THAT AND YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY APPLY 
POD1000000048_S0000234	UM SO SO SOMETIMES AH I I FIND PEOPLE WHO WANT TO WORK ON A I POLICY BECAUSE THEY DON'T SEE THEMSELVES AS QUITE CUT OUT FOR FOR TECHNICAL CORE RESEARCH PERHAPS BECAUSE THEIR MATH SKILLS AREN'T QUITE GOOD ENOUGH 
POD1000000048_S0000235	AH IS THAT A SENSIBLE WAY TO GO OR IS IN SOME WAYS THE A I STRATEGY WORK AH HARDER JUST BECAUSE IT'S IT'S LESS CLEAR IT'S LESS PRECISE THAN THAN TECHNICAL WORK 
POD1000000048_S0000236	UM I WOULDN'T SAY IT'S HARDER OR EASIER IT'S JUST DIFFERENT AH BUT EVEN EVEN ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE THERE'S THERE'S A LOT OF AH FUZZINESS 
POD1000000048_S0000237	SO AH YOU KNOW A I SAFETY WASN'T VERY CRISPLY DEFINED A FEW YEARS AGO AND IT'S STARTING TO MOVE MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF TECHNICAL RIGOR 
POD1000000048_S0000238	AND I THINK THE SAME THING WILL HAPPEN TO A I POLICY TO SOME EXTENT BUT THERE WILL ALSO ALWAYS BE SOME ELEMENT OF AH RELATIONSHIP BUILDING AND AND YOU KNOW QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS AND SO FORTH 
POD1000000048_S0000239	THAT AH THAT CERTAINLY IS IS NOT EXACTLY THE SAME AS AS SOLVING TECHNICAL PROBLEMS SO AH YES I DO THINK THAT HAVING AH A DIFFERENT BACKGROUND WOULD AH IT WOULD MAKE SENSE TO CHOOSE DIFFERENT AREAS TO WORK WITH BASE BASED ON YOUR BACKGROUND 
POD1000000048_S0000240	BUT I WOULDN'T SAY THAT AH YOU KNOW WORKING ON THE SAFETY PROBLEM IS TOTALLY TECHNICAL AND THE POLICY PROBLEM IS TOTALLY NON-TECHNICAL AH BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S SOME CORRELATION THERE 
POD1000000048_S0000241	AND WHAT KIND OF LEVEL OF TECHNICAL UM UNDERSTANDING DO YOU HAVE TO GET TO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A USEFUL CONTRIBUTION 
POD1000000048_S0000242	UM I'M NOT SURE THAT YOU NEED ANY SPECIFIC LEVEL IN ORDER TO MAKE SOME CONTRIBUTION SO AH FOR EXAMPLE THERE ARE THERE ARE A LOT OF ROLES THAT CAN BE PLAYED BY PEOPLE WHO ARE JUST YOU KNOW GOOD AT DISTILLING THE LITERATURE ON A PARTICULAR TOPIC 
POD1000000048_S0000243	SO FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN AH UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE THAT A I COULD AH PLAY IN AUTHORITARIAN STATES 
POD1000000048_S0000244	THEN YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO HAVE ANY TECHNICAL BACKGROUND TO READ UP ON THE LITERATURE AROUND SURVEILLANCE AND COERCION AND AH AND THINGS LIKE THAT 
POD1000000048_S0000245	SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR AH JUST GOOD SYNTHESIZERS AND AND PEOPLE WHO ARE CURIOUS AND INTERESTED TO DIP IN AREAS THEY'RE UNFAMILIAR WITH 
POD1000000048_S0000246	UM BUT I THINK THERE'S ALSO A FAIRLY HIGH CEILING FOR YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD BE USEFUL 
POD1000000048_S0000247	I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE GOOD TO HAVE PEOPLE WITH VERY STRONG TECHNICAL BACKGROUNDS THINKING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THE NITTY THE NITTY GRITTY GAME THEORY ISSUES RELATED TO ARMS RACES AND SO FORTH 
POD1000000048_S0000248	SO I THINK YEAH IT'S A PRETTY IT'S A PRETTY BROAD RANGE OF POSSIBLE AH SKILL SETS THAT WOULD BE USEFUL 
POD1000000048_S0000249	RIGHT SO YOU'RE THINKING IF YOU CAN JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU CAN SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT AN A I MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF DOING IN THE FUTURE AND THEN IF YOU KNOW ECONOMICS OR IF YOU KNOW SOCIAL SCIENCE 
POD1000000048_S0000250	THEN YOU CAN THINK WHAT IMPLICATIONS WOULD THAT HAVE FOR POLITICS AND THAT KIND OF THING EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND SPECIFICALLY HOW THE HOW THE A I WOULD WORK 
POD1000000048_S0000251	YEAH IDEALLY YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EACH OF THOSE THINGS BUT YOU DON'T NEED TO BE AN EXPERT IN EVERYTHING IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO BE AN EXPERT IN EVERYTHING 
POD1000000048_S0000252	SO AH YOU IT'S NOT AH FEASIBLE TO TO LEARN ABOUT EVERY EVERY SINGLE DISCIPLINE OF OF WHICH I'LL LIST SEVERAL IN THIS AH POLICY AH CAREER GUIDE THAT THAT YOU MENTIONED 
POD1000000048_S0000253	AH CLEARLY YOU CANNOT BE AN EXPERT AH YOU KNOW A DEEP EXPERT IN IN TECHNICAL A I ECONOMICS SOCIOLOGY POLITICAL SCIENCE ETC 
POD1000000048_S0000254	AH BUT KNOWING A LITTLE BIT AND AND BEING ABLE TO COLLABORATE WITH PEOPLE WITH COMPLEMENTARY SKILL SETS IS ALSO VERY VALUABLE 
POD1000000048_S0000255	SO AH I THINK A LOT OF THE THE MOST EXCITING WORK IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL INVOLVE COLLABORATION BETWEEN PEOPLE ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND ON THE POLICY SIDE 
POD1000000048_S0000256	RIGHT SO SO HOW CAN SOMEONE TELL WHICH WHICH KIND OF PATHS THEY'RE MOST SUITED FOR 
POD1000000048_S0000258	UM I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY CLEAR ALGORITHM FOR THIS BUT TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE AREA AND AND IN READING AH SOME OF THE LITERATURE AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE AH WHERE YOU THINK THE GAPS ARE 
POD1000000048_S0000259	WHAT AH WHAT AREAS YOU THINK THAT YOU CAN SHED LIGHT ON GIVEN YOUR BACKGROUND IS DEFINITELY SOMETHING AH YOU SHOULD DO AH 
POD1000000048_S0000260	YOU SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT SORTS OF JOB OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE AND YOU KNOW CAST A FAIRLY BROAD NET YOU KNOW BECAUSE YOU DON'T NECESSARILY KNOW WHAT WHAT'S GOING TO STRIKE YOUR INTEREST UNTIL YOU STUMBLE UPON THAT OPPORTUNITY 
POD1000000048_S0000261	AND NETWORKING IS ALSO SUPER HELPFUL SO I THINK NOT JUST IN TERMS OF FINDING OUT ABOUT JOB OPPORTUNITIES AND FIGURING OUT WHERE THERE'S A NICE FIT BUT ALSO FINDING OUT ABOUT AH DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURES AND AH WHERE YOU MIGHT FIT IN IS AH ALSO USEFUL 
POD1000000048_S0000262	SO UM YEAH I DON'T THINK THERE'S AH A SINGLE ALGORITHM BUT NETWORKING AND READING MORE OF THE LITERATURE AND LOOKING AT JOB JOB POSTINGS ARE ALL GOOD THINGS TO DO 
POD1000000048_S0000263	YEAH WHAT KINDS OF AH PLACES CAN PEOPLE NETWORK ARE THERE ANY EVENTS THAT ARE OPEN TO PEOPLE WHO DON'T YET HAVE ROLES 
POD1000000048_S0000264	YEAH SO AH ALL OF THE A I CONFERENCES ARE OPEN TO ANYONE WHO IS CAPABLE OF AH YOU KNOW MAKE YOU KNOW PAYING FOR THE TRIP AND THE THE TICKET 
POD1000000048_S0000265	SO AH SO SOME EXAMPLES OF OF BIG A I A I CONFERENCES ARE NIPS I C M L AH 
POD1000000048_S0000267	UM TRIPLE A I AND SO FORTH 
POD1000000048_S0000268	UM AH YEAH NIPS YOU KNOW THE BIGGEST AH UM YOU KNOW MACHINE LEARNING CONFERENCE RIGHT NOW WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DEEP LEARNING I C M L IS ALSO A VERY LARGE ONE ACTUALLY I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE OF THOSE IS BIGGER 
POD1000000048_S0000269	AH I HAVEN'T BEEN TO I C M L BUT I'VE BEEN TO NIPS A FEW TIMES AH I CLEAR I C L R IS AH ALSO A DEEP LEARNING SPECIFIC AH CONFERENCE 
POD1000000048_S0000270	SO I THINK GOING TO CONFERENCES LIKE THAT AND SPECIFICALLY GOING TO WORKSHOPS AND SYMPOSIA THAT ARE RELEVANT TO POLICY QUESTIONS WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS AT THESE CONFERENCES 
POD1000000048_S0000271	AH SO FOR EXAMPLE AT NIPS LAST YEAR THERE WAS UM THERE WAS A SYMPOSIUM ON THE A I AND THE LAW SO AH THERE 
POD1000000048_S0000272	THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES LIKE THAT TO NETWORK AND FIND AH FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HOW PEOPLE IN THAT AREA ARE THINKING AND TO MEET PEOPLE UM WHO HAVE SIMILAR INTERESTS 
POD1000000048_S0000273	UM AND YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST ON THE A I SIDE IT'S ALSO AH IT'S ALSO WE'RE THINKING ABOUT MORE AH POLICY ORIENTED CONFERENCES SO THERE'S SOME CONFERENCES LIKE THE GOVERNANCE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES CONFERENCE 
POD1000000048_S0000274	AH THE WE ROBOT CONFERENCE SERIES AND PROBABLY A FEW OTHERS THAT WOULD BE OF INTEREST AH TO PEOPLE WHO ARE YOU KNOW EITHER ON THE TECHNICAL SIDE AND WANT TO MOVE IN A MORE THINKING ABOUT POLICY SIDE 
POD1000000048_S0000275	OR JUST THEY'RE IN THE POLICY SIDE BUT THEY WANNA YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY SEEK OUT PEOPLE INTERESTED IN A I AH THOSE THOSE WOULD BE GOOD PLACES TO LOOK 
POD1000000048_S0000276	UM AND ARE ANY OF THE ORGANIZATIONS INVOLVED OPEN ENOUGH THAT AH SOMEONE WHO'S INTERESTED IN THE AREA AH CAN CAN DROP BY AND AND GET TO KNOW PEOPLE 
POD1000000048_S0000277	YEAH SO UM I THINK AH PARTICULARLY ON THE ACADEMIC SIDE THOUGH TO SOME EXTENT ALSO AT CORPORATIONS AH THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF OPENNESS 
POD1000000048_S0000278	AND AH YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE AT F H I WE HOST A LOT OF VISITORS AH WHO JUST WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR WORK AND THE SAME IS TRUE OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS 
POD1000000048_S0000280	YEAH UM SO IT SOUNDED LIKE IN YOUR GUIDE YOU THOUGHT THE BEST UNDERGRADUATE MAJOR WAS WAS SOMETHING LIKE COMBINING A TECHNICAL SUBJECT 
POD1000000048_S0000281	LIKE MATH OR COMPUTER SCIENCE WITH A MORE SOCIAL SCIENCE TOPIC LIKE POLITICS OR ECONOMICS 
POD1000000048_S0000282	UM ASSUMING THAT POST PEOPLE LISTENING TO THIS HAVE ALREADY CHOSEN THEIR MAJOR WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO AT THE POSTGRADUATE LEVEL SHOULD SHOULD THEY DO A P H D OR JUST GO AND WORK DIRECTLY AT AT GOOGLE IF THEY CAN 
POD1000000048_S0000284	I 
POD1000000048_S0000286	I MEAN I'VE I'VE PROBABLY SAID THIS A MILLION TIMES BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR ANSWER FOR EVERYONE AH BUT AH 
POD1000000048_S0000288	BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T HURT TO HAVE AN ADVANCED DEGREE OF COURSE THERE ARE OPPORTUNITY COSTS BUT THERE THERE'S CERTAINLY MORE JOB OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE FOR SOMEONE WHO AH YOU KNOW HAS HAS A P H D 
POD1000000048_S0000289	SO FOR EXAMPLE UM I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A HARD REQUIREMENT AH BUT CERTAINLY IT WOULD BE A BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE APPLYING TO A FAIR NUMBER OF INDUSTRY JOBS AH IF THEY HAD AN ADVANCED DEGREE 
POD1000000048_S0000290	UM AS WELL AS IN ACADEMIA SO IT IT'S HARD TO AVOID THE FACT THAT AH YOU KNOW FOR ACADEMIC JOBS AS MUCH AS AH UM YEAH WE WOULD LIKE TO YOU KNOW HIRE PEOPLE SOLELY BASED ON THEIR DEMONSTRATED SKILLS 
POD1000000048_S0000291	OFTEN ALSO THE CASE THAT THERE ARE UNIVERSITY POLICIES SURROUNDING YOU KNOW WHAT SORTS OF DEGREES YOU NEED FOR FOR DIFFERENT ROLES AND AH PAY GRADES AND SO 
POD1000000048_S0000292	AH THERE'S DEFINITELY VALUE TO HAVING A GRADUATE DEGREE AH DESPITE THE YOU KNOW NON-TRIVIAL OPPORTUNITY COST IF FI YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY 
POD1000000048_S0000293	BUT AH YOU KNOW AS WITH ALL THESE THINGS IT IT DEPENDS ON SOMEONE'S BACKGROUND AND IF YOU HAVE A CLEAR OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN IMPACT 
POD1000000048_S0000294	AH AND YOU COULD YOU KNOW PERHAPS GET SOME OF THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS BY YOU KNOW ALSO TAKING CLASSES ONLINE OR ENROLLING AT A LOCAL UNIVERSITY AND BEING A PART TIME P H D STUDENT OR MASTER'S STUDENT I THINK 
POD1000000048_S0000295	YEAH YOU SHOULD YEAH AH THERE MIGHT BE WAYS TO HAVE YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO BUT AH IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR PERSON 
POD1000000048_S0000296	YEAH AND AND I GUESS THE MOST OBVIOUS OPTIONS AT THE POSTGRADUATE LEVEL ARE THINGS LIKE MACHINE LEARNING OR COMPUTER SCIENCE OR OR ECONOMICS SO I GUESS PUBLIC POLICY IS THAT USEFUL 
POD1000000048_S0000297	YEAH SO AH UM YEAH JUST TO GIVE A PARTICULAR EXAMPLE UM AT OXFORD WE HAVE A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN A I SAFETY AND A I POLICY AS WELL AS BROADER ISSUES RELATED TO THE FUTURE 
POD1000000048_S0000298	UM AND YOU KNOW JUST AT THE ORGANIZATION THAT I'M AT F H I THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER CURRENTLY ENROLLED OR WHO SOON WILL BE ENROLLED IN PROGRAMS AH IN MINE WHICH IS HUMAN AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
POD1000000048_S0000299	AS WELL AS MACHINE LEARNING AH CYBER SECURITY AND ZOOLOGY SO THERE THERE'S A WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBLE AREAS THAT ONE COULD STUDY AND YOU KNOW FIND AN ADVISOR THAT IS SUITABLE AND INTERESTED IN SUPPORTING YEAH INTERESTING WORK 
POD1000000048_S0000301	YEAH SO SO SOME PEOPLE WORRY THAT DOING WORK IN THIS THIS IN THIS AREA COULD COULD BE HARMFUL IF NOT DONE WELL AH SO FOR EXAMPLE IT COULD BE THAT AS YOU WERE SAYING EARLIER THAT REGULATION IN THIS AREA AH COULD COULD BE DONE POORLY AND WOULD ACTUALLY BE HARMFUL OVERALL 
POD1000000048_S0000302	OR THAT BRINGING GREATER ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE COULD COULD REINFORCE THE ARMS RACE DYNAMIC OR TENTATIVELY HAVING PEOPLE AH GET INVOLVED WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TECHNICAL EXPERTISE COULD COULD BRING THE AREA INTO DISREPUTE 
POD1000000048_S0000303	AH HOW SERIOUSLY DO YOU TAKE THOSE KINDS OF CONCERNS SHOULD SHOULD PEOPLE BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT ABOUT AH JUMPING INTO THE AREA IF IF THEY DON'T FEEL LIKE THEY'RE REALLY ON TOP OF THINGS 
POD1000000048_S0000304	UM I 
POD1000000048_S0000306	THINK THAT IS A REASONABLE CONCERN AH AND YEAH THERE THERE IS 
POD1000000048_S0000307	IN FACT SOME SOME RISK OF AH YOU KNOW DISCREDITING YOURSELF OR YOUR CAUSE BY AH BY BEING UM YOU KNOW TOO TOO ALARMIST OR WHATEVER THE PARTICULAR CHARGE MIGHT BE 
POD1000000048_S0000308	BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THERE'S A LOT OF NOISE IN THE SYSTEM NO MATTER WHAT AND WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOU DO IN THE NEAR TERM THERE WILL BE TERMINATOR PICTURES AND AND PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW DISMISS A I SAFETY AND AH ALL SORTS OF OTHER THINGS YOU CAN'T REALLY CONTROL 
POD1000000048_S0000309	SO I I THINK THEY'RE ALSO RISKS OF NOT ACTING WHICH IS YOU KNOW NOT AH YOU KNOW NOT BEING ABLE TO AH HELP OUT WHEN THERE'S AN IMPORTANT PROGRAM AND YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE 
POD1000000048_S0000310	SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW IF IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT CONCERNS YOU THEN TALK TO PEOPLE ABOUT YOU KNOW YOUR BELIEFS AND WHAT YOUR BELIEFS ARE YOU KNOW 
POD1000000048_S0000311	WHETHER THERE'S YOU KNOW AND LOOK AT SURVEYS OF EXPERTS AND YOU KNOW SEE SEE HOW AH YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT THE YOU KNOW REASONABLE DISTRIBUTION IS AMONG PEOPLE WHO HAVE STUDIED THE TOPIC MORE 
POD1000000048_S0000312	SO AH I DON'T THINK IT'S YOU KNOW AN ALL OR NOTHING SORT OF THING WHERE YOU EITHER HAVE TO STAY IGNORANT OR BE A SUPER EXPERT 
POD1000000048_S0000313	I THINK THERE'S THERE'S A MIDDLE GROUND WHERE YOU SORT OF YOU KNOW DEVELOP YOUR CONFIDENCE LITTLE BY LITTLE AS YOU GO AND TRYING AH REMAIN AS MODEST AS POSSIBLE IN AREAS THAT YOU HAVE LITTLE EXPERTISE 
POD1000000048_S0000314	YEAH I SUPPOSE YOU COULD ALWAYS TRACK THE THINGS THAT YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE YOU OR NICK BOSTROM ARE SAYING AND HOW YOU SPEAK ABOUT THE ISSUES SO THAT YOU SO YOU DON'T COME ACROSS AS ALARMIST AND YOU KNOW YOU YOU HAVE A MEASURED AND PRECISE TONE 
POD1000000048_S0000315	RIGHT RIGHT 
POD1000000048_S0000316	YEAH SO SO YOU MENTIONED EARLIER THAT A I AH COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED IN MILITARY APPLICATIONS AND THAT'S ONE WAY THAT THINGS COULD GO BADLY UM GIVEN THAT DO YOU SEE MUCH VALUE IN PEOPLE GOING INTO MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE ROLES TO WITH WITH THE HOPE OF LIMITING THIS AH IN THE IN THE FUTURE 
POD1000000048_S0000318	POSSIBLY AH IT'S REALLY HARD TO SAY IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR ROLE SO AH PROBABLY A ROLE YOU KNOW HIGHER UP IN THE CHAIN AND MORE ON THE POLICY AND STRATEGY SIDES OF THINGS 
POD1000000048_S0000319	AS OPPOSED TO THE MORE OPERATIONAL OR LOGISTICAL OR JUST EXECUTION SIDE OF THINGS AH WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO GIVE YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO AFFECT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS 
POD1000000048_S0000320	BUT AH THERE MIGHT ALSO BE BENEFITS TO THAT AH BEYOND JUST AH YOU KNOW HAVING A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE ISSUE WHILE IN THAT ROLE 
POD1000000048_S0000321	YOU COULD ALSO THEN DEVELOP VALUABLE CONNECTIONS AND AH KNOW THE RIGHT PEOPLE TO INFLUENCE FROM THE OUTSIDE AH DOWN THE ROAD OR AH HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE DYNAMICS OF THE PROBLEM AH AND YOU KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO SOLVE IT SO 
POD1000000048_S0000322	AH I I DEFINITELY WOULDN'T AH DISMISS IT BUT I ALSO YOU KNOW WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RECOMMEND IT ACROSS THE BOARD AS AS THE BEST THING TO DO 
POD1000000048_S0000323	YEAH I I GUESS THE INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AND MILITARY ARE JUST SUCH ENORMOUS BUREAUCRACIES I SUPPOSE I'D I'D WORRY THAT SOMEONE YOU LIKE AH IT'S JUST UNLIKELY PERHAPS THAT YOU WOULD BE IN THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME OR OR HAVE ENOUGH DISCRETION IN THOSE ROLES TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE 
POD1000000048_S0000324	BUT AS YOU SAY IT COULD COULD HELP YOU TO BUILD UP YOUR CAREER CAPITAL SO YOU CAN GET AH OTHER OTHER GOOD USEFUL ROLES IN THE FUTURE AND AND YOU KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS SO YOU COULD POTENTIALLY INFLUENCE IT AH FROM OUTSIDE AND TALK TO THE RIGHT PEOPLE 
POD1000000048_S0000325	YEAH EXACTLY SO AH YOU KNOW AGAIN IT WOULD DEPEND ON THE PARTICULAR PERSON AND WHAT OTHER OPTIONS THEY HAVE BUT IT'S CERTAINLY WORTH CONSIDERING 
POD1000000048_S0000326	UM WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY COULD IT BE USEFUL TO GO INTO DEPARTMENT OF STATE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WORK ON ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS 
POD1000000048_S0000327	SO YOU KNOW EVEN JUST CURRENT ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS SO YOU YOU UNDERSTAND HOW THEY WORK AND CAN THINK ABOUT HOW THEY MIGHT WORK FOR A I IN FUTURE 
POD1000000048_S0000329	YEAH SO I THINK THAT COULD BE VERY USEFUL AH LOOKING AT ARMS CONTROL AND FOREIGN POLICY YOU KNOW BOTH FROM AN ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE AND FROM A PRACTITIONER PERSPECTIVE I THINK IT'S VERY VALUABLE 
POD1000000048_S0000330	AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT AH WERE NOT THAT'S NOT OUR STRONG SUIT IN THE A I SAFETY AND POLICY COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW 
POD1000000048_S0000331	AH SO MORE MORE COULD BE DONE ON THAT FRONT AH BUT I I THINK SOME OF THE SAME CAVEATS APPLY TO THE THE AS TO THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE SIDE OF THINGS THAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR EXAMPLE IS A VERY LARGE BUREAUCRACY 
POD1000000048_S0000332	YEAH AH AND HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT UM JUST MORE GENERAL ATTEMPTS TO AH TO MAKE THE WORLD AH AH BETTER SUCH THAT WHEN A I IS DEVELOPED THINGS ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO WELL 
POD1000000048_S0000333	FOR EXAMPLE JUST IMPROVING THE YOU KNOW QUALITY OF GOVERNMENT AH IN GENERAL TRYING TO GET GET THE RIGHT KINDS OF PEOPLE ELECTED OR IMPROVING OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST THE FUTURE ACROSS THE BOARD 
POD1000000048_S0000335	IS IS I GUESS ONE WORRY WOULD BE THAT THAT'S JUST NOT SUFFICIENTLY LEVERAGED ON ON THIS SPECIFIC PROBLEM AND IF YOU THINK A I IS REALLY LIKELY TO BE THE KEY ISSUE THEN YOU WANT TO WORK ON THAT SPECIFICALLY 
POD1000000048_S0000336	UM BUT MAYBE IF YOU COULD IMPROVE OUR ABILITY TO FORECAST TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE FUTURE ACROSS THE BOARD THEN THAT COULD BE A BETTER OPTION AND ALSO UM YOU JUST HAVE A LOT MORE OPTIONS IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE OPEN TO BROADER WAYS OF IMPROVING THE WORLD 
POD1000000048_S0000337	YEAH I I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR DECISION FOR EVERYONE BUT IT IT BOTH AT THE YOU KNOW GROUP LEVEL AND AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL IT OFTEN MAKES SENSE TO TAKE A SUM IT UP A PORTFOLIO APPROACH 
POD1000000048_S0000338	SO AH THERE ARE PEOPLE AT F H I WHO ALSO ARE AFFILIATED WITH THE CENTER FOR EFFECTIVE ALTRUISM AND INVOLVED IN BUILDING THE E A COMMUNITY AH LIKE OWEN COTTON-BARRATT AND TOBY ORD 
POD1000000048_S0000339	SO THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO STRADDLE AH THAT BOUNDARY AND AND YOU KNOW LOOK FOR OPPORTUNITIES TO BENEFIT BOTH SIDES AND THERE ARE ALSO PEOPLE AH YOU KNOW WHO FOCUS ON ONE THING OR THE OTHERS 
POD1000000048_S0000340	SO I DON'T THINK THERE'S A CLEAR RIGHT ANSWER BUT AH CERTAINLY THE THE SORTS OF TRADE OFFS YOU MENTION SOUND REASONABLE ON THE ONE HAND ONE WOULD WANT AH THE WORLD TO BE IN A BETTER PLACE 
POD1000000048_S0000341	FOR THERE TO BE MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING CAREFULLY ABOUT AH MAKING AH MAKING GOOD DECISIONS AND BENEFITING AH FUTURE PEOPLE UM IN IN VARIOUS IMPORTANT DECISION-MAKING ROLES 
POD1000000048_S0000342	AH BUT THERE IT IT'S QUITE UNCERTAIN YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT IMPACT YOU COULD HAVE ON A I AND LIKEWISE EVEN EVEN IF YOU WORK DIRECTLY ON A I IT'S NOT TOTALLY CLEAR THAT AH THAT'S ALWAYS THE BEST THING YOU SHOULD DO 
POD1000000048_S0000343	BUT YOU KNOW I HAVE A SLIGHTY YOU KNOW BIAS TOWARDS THINKING THAT WORK THAT DIRECT WORK IS IS AH YOU KNOW NEEDS MORE ATTENTION AT THE MOMENT UM BUT AH I THINK YOU KNOW THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE THAT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT 
POD1000000048_S0000344	BECAUSE YOU KNOW I WOULD LIKE MORE PEOPLE TO HELP SOLVE THE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS I'M WORKING ON 
POD1000000048_S0000345	SO SO WE SHOULD POTENTIALLY CONTINUE TRYING TO GET PEOPLE INVOLVED WE'LL JUST BECOME A I RESEARCHERS RIGHT AWAY 
POD1000000048_S0000346	RIGHT 
POD1000000048_S0000347	SO SO THAT'S AH THAT'S ALL OF MY QUESTIONS WAS THERE ANYTHING YOU WANTED TO ADD 
POD1000000048_S0000348	ANY INSPIRING MESSAGE 
POD1000000048_S0000349	UM YEAH I MEAN I'LL JUST CIRCLE BACK ON WHAT I WAS SAYING EARLIER WHICH IS THAT AH A I SAFETY WAS IN A VERY AH UM NEBULOUS STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT A FEW YEARS AGO 
POD1000000048_S0000350	AND IT TOOK THE WORK OF AH NICK BOSTROM IN SUPERINTELLIGENCE AND STUART RUSSELL IN GIVING A LOT OF TALKS AND WRITING OP-EDS TO CALL MORE ATTENTION TO IT AND GIVE IT MORE LEGITIMACY 
POD1000000048_S0000351	AH AND THEN SUBSEQUENT WORK WAS DONE TO REFINE THE ISSUE AND DEVELOP RESEARCH AGENDAS AH AH BY BY PEOPLE INCLUDING THE AUTHORS OF HE CONCRETE PROBLEMS IN A I SAFETY PAPER 
POD1000000048_S0000352	AH AND NOW WE HAVE A LOT OF POSTDOCS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS WORKING SPECIFICALLY ON THIS WE HAVE PEOPLE IN INDUSTRY SPECIFICALLY WORKING ON WELL DEFINED PROBLEMS IN THIS SPACE 
POD1000000048_S0000353	AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A SIMILAR TRANSITION IN A I POLICY OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS 
POD1000000048_S0000354	TO REMOVING FROM AH FAIRLY HIGH LEVEL DESIDERATA AND AND PROBLEM FRAMINGS TO SPECIFIC PROPOSALS AND AH YOU KNOW AH FORMAL MODELS AND AH YOU KNOW AH GOOD WHITE PAPERS 
POD1000000048_S0000355	AND SO FORTH AH OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND IT'S IT'S AN AREA THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE'S EXPERTISE SO I WOULD DEFINITELY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO AH WHO YOU KNOW THINK THEY MIGHT HAVE SOME RELEVANT EXPERTISE TO SERIOUSLY CONSIDER 
POD1000000048_S0000356	UM YEAH I'LL JUST REITERATE THAT SINCE I WROTE OUR PROBLEM PROFILE ON POSITIVELY SHAPING ARTIFICIAL DEVELOPMENT WE'VE HEARD FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO THINK THAT THIS IS THE MOST NEGLECTED AREA AH WITHIN WITHIN THE A I SAFETY 
POD1000000048_S0000357	AH AND I'M I'M VERY KEEN TO GET AH MORE PEOPLE AH WORKING ON THESE ON THESE PROBLEMS AND GETTING MORE ORGANIZATIONS AH HIRING FOR THEM AH SO IF IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN 
POD1000000048_S0000358	I THINK YOU SHOULD YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY BE BE LOOKING INTO IT MORE AND AND WE'LL PUT UP AH LINKS TO TO GUIDES WHERE YOU CAN AH FIND OUT MORE AND AND MEET THE RIGHT PEOPLE

YOU1000000000_S0000081	AND SO THEY DECIDED THE YOU KNOW TO UM DID NOT YOU KNOW HAVE THE TRUCK HERE ANYMORE 
YOU1000000000_S0000082	AND THEN YOU KNOW AH THE MARKER WAS BASICALLY THIS COMPACT OR MID SIZE PICKUP SEGMENT YOU KNOW LARGELY DOMINATED BY A TOYOTA TACOMA HAS BEEN FOR A LONG TIME 
YOU1000000000_S0000083	BUT THE NISSAN FRONTIER KEPT IN THERE BUT THOSE YOU KNOW THE TACOMA ESPECIALLY QUIET AN OLD DESIGN AS WELL 
YOU1000000000_S0000084	THAN AH CHEVY WITH THEIR COLORADO AND G M C WITH THE TWIN THE CANYON 
YOU1000000000_S0000085	YOU KNOW REDESIGN THEIR PICKUPS AND I THINK FORD LOOKED AT IT LIKE OKAY HOLD IT WE STILL WE HAVE A RANGER THAT'S SOLD IN OTHER MARKETS 
YOU1000000000_S0000086	THIS AND YOU KNOW THE RIDGELINE WAS REDESIGN CAME BACK WAS REDESIGN JEEP GLADIATORS IS COMING OUT 
YOU1000000000_S0000087	I THINK THEY SAID WE GOTTA GET BACK IN THIS MARKET BECAUSE PICKUPS ARE STILL HOT IN THIS COUNTRY 
YOU1000000000_S0000088	UM AND SO THEY THEY HAVE THIS EXISTING DESIGN SOLD UP ELSEWHERE 
YOU1000000000_S0000089	THEY'VE BROUGHT IT BACK HERE AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE NOW IT'S TWENTY-NINETEEN FORD RANGER 
YOU1000000000_S0000090	AND NOT EVERYONE NEEDS YOU KNOW AH AH AH FIFTEEN HUNDRED HALF TON PICKUP TRUCK I MEAN

YOU1000000000_S0000092	ANOTHER SHORT JOKE THEY'VE RUNNING BIRDS THE THIS IS WHAT THIS IS I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THIS SEGMENT BECAUSE THIS TRUCK THE THE RANGER WE HAVE WAS ABOUT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
YOU1000000000_S0000094	YOU CAN GET A FULL SIZE TRUCK FOR A LITTLE MORE MONEY AND I PERSONALLY I THINK IT'S CRAZY BECAUSE I DON'T FIT IN THESE TRUCKS AS WELL 
YOU1000000000_S0000095	UM AND THERE IT'S IT'S HALF IT'S HALF THE TRUCK I MEAN IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME FOR THAT KINDA MONEY IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE SPACE AH SPACE CONSCIOUS YOU WANT A SMALLER VEHICLE IT MAKES SOME SENSE BUT BEYOND THAT 
YOU1000000000_S0000096	AND AND AND I POST IT ON CONSUME REPORTS FACEBOOK PAGE AH AH A PICTURE OF OF THE NEW RANGER 
YOU1000000000_S0000097	AND WE SPENT FORTY THOUSAND DOLLAR AND ALMOST EVERY COMMENT WAS FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS 
YOU1000000000_S0000098	IT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR THAT 
YOU1000000000_S0000099	SO YOU KNOW WE WE TRY TO OUT FIT THE TRUCKS A CERTAIN WAY YOU KNOW WE ALL CARS WE TRY TO OUT FIT THE WAY WE THINK MOST PEOPLE ARE GONNA THE WAY THE TRUCKS ARE GONNA BE SOLD SO THAT'S WHY RIGHT NOW THAT TRUCK IS FORTY THOUSAND 
YOU1000000000_S0000101	A CURRENT FULL SIZE TRUCKS OR RIGHT NOW AND THEN UP AND ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND SO FOR TEN THOUSAND MORE YOU'RE GONNA IT HAVE A REALLY NICE FULL SIZE TRUCK NOT A TRIPPER 
YOU1000000000_S0000102	THAT'S WHAT I MEAN EITHER WAY I DROVE IT I DROVE IT LAST NIGHT AND I I I WAS PLEASED ACTUALLY

YOU1000000000_S0000104	IT DOESN'T EXCITE ME WHEN I DRIVE IT I AM JUST AH UM THE COLORADO IS THE SAME THING UM I FIT IN THAT BETTER THIS THING I ACTUALLY FIT IN QUIET WELL THE SEATING POSITION IN NICE I CAN SEE 
YOU1000000000_S0000105	UM MY GREAT UM THE THE POWER TRAIN IT'S GOT A UM FULL CYLINDER UM ECO BOOST UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000107	YEAH AND IT'S HAS POINT OF POWER BUT IT'S NOT SMOOTH THERE'S THERE'S SOME SORT OF A DRIVE LINE VIBRATION I FEEL UM I'M NOT GONNA HALPHEN THAT TOO MUCH CAUSE IT MIGHT BE THIS THING NEEDS TO BREAK IN A LITTLE MORE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MILE 
YOU1000000000_S0000108	FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MILES WE CAN DRIVE IT THAT FAR 
YOU1000000000_S0000109	BROKE OUR RECORD FROM FOUR MILES ON IT 
YOU1000000000_S0000110	IT'S ONLY GOT FOUR HUNDRED MILES ON IT ROUGHLY AND UM THINGS ARE GONNA BREAK KEEP YOU KNOW SETTLING AND BREAKING 
YOU1000000000_S0000111	WE'VE NOTICED THAT THINGS LIKE TRANSMISSIONS AH CHANGE OVER OUT BREAKING THEORY LIKE SOMETIMES QUIET OF AND GETS SMOOTHER 
YOU1000000000_S0000112	AND AND YOU KNOW THE TRANSMISSION IT WAS A COUPLE UM GOOFY SHIFTS AND YOU KNOW THESE THINGS YEAH THESE THINGS GET IRONED OUT BUT I MEAN 
YOU1000000000_S0000113	IT'S GOT IT'S GOT PLENTY OF POWER I WAS I WAS HAPPY WITH THAT THE THE THE TACOMA FEELS UNDER POWER TO ME EVEN THE COLORADO FEELS AH UNDER POWER TO ME 
YOU1000000000_S0000114	THIS THING ON THE HIGHWAY I NOTICED QUIET A BIT OF WIND NOISE FROM THE DOOR SEALS AND AH YOU KNOW JUST A YEAH THE SEALS I GUESS UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000116	AND OTHER THAN THAT IT'S GOT 
YOU1000000000_S0000117	I'M WITH YOU AH IN A LOT WAYS I WAS ACTUALLY REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS TRUCK SO AH IN SOME WAYS I WAS A LITTLE MORE LET DOWN 
YOU1000000000_S0000118	BECAUSE I I'VE REALLY TO THINK WE NEED A REALLY GOOD I THINK WE THE MARKET NEEDS A REALLY GOOD COMPACT GEAR PICKUP 
YOU1000000000_S0000119	IT LOOKS APART NO QUESTION ABOUT IT AND IT'S A REAL TRUCK UNLIKE THE HONDA RIDGELINE WHICH IS REALLY JUST A GLORIFIED YOU KNOW S U V YEAH BASICALLY A CAR 
YOU1000000000_S0000120	UM THIS IS A REAL TRUCK THE BIGGEST GREAT FOR ME IS THE RIDE IT HAS ONE OF THE STIFFEST BOUNCIEST RIDES I THINK OF ANY PICKUP ON THE MARKET RIGHT NOW UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000121	YOU THINK IT'S WORST THAN THE DICOMA 
YOU1000000000_S0000122	I'M NOT SAYING IT'S WORSE I'M SAYING IT'S 
YOU1000000000_S0000123	I DON'T THINK I THINK IT RIDE FAIR THAN DICOMA 
YOU1000000000_S0000124	AH AH I I THINK INTERESTING 
YOU1000000000_S0000125	I'M I'M WITH RYAN ON THIS ACTUALLY AH I I IT'S NOT A SMOOTH RIDE 
YOU1000000000_S0000127	SO IF YOU IF YOU YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE PICK A PERSON YOU'RE GONNA PUT UP WITH THAT I HAD IT FOR A WEEKEND AND I DROVE PUT A LOT OF MILES ON IT 
YOU1000000000_S0000128	AND I WAS FINE WITH IT BUT IT'S DEFINITELY NOTICEABLY BOUNCY AND ROUGH A ROAD JUST TRUCKY NO QUESTION ABOUT IT 
YOU1000000000_S0000129	SO I'VE THAT'S PROBABLY MY BIG DESCRIBE IS THAT IT'S YOU KNOW IF YOU SOMEONE WHO BUYS A RIDGELINE THIS IS THIS IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 
YOU1000000000_S0000130	YOU CAN'T EVEN COMPARE THOSE TWO 
YOU1000000000_S0000131	BUT PEOPLE DO THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND WE DO I MEAN WE COMPARE 
YOU1000000000_S0000132	BIG FAN OF A RIDGELINE IT DRIVES IT DRIVES REALLY NICELY BUT THE THING 
YOU1000000000_S0000133	YEAH THE PILOT I MEAN IT OF COURSE IT RIDES WELL BUT 
YOU1000000000_S0000134	YOU KNOW I AGREE WITH YOU ON ON THE DRIVE TRAIN THOUGH IT'S TO ME IT SOUNDS WHEEZY 
YOU1000000000_S0000135	IT'S IT'S SOUND WHEEZY YET IT'S GOT GOOD POWERS AND THEN ALSO KEEP IN MIND IT HAS A TEN SPEED AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION 
YOU1000000000_S0000136	IT'S PRETTY IMPRESSIVE YOU KNOW AND AND AND I FOUND IN GENERAL IT SHIFTS PRETTY SMOOTHLY IT'S NO BREAKING IN 
YOU1000000000_S0000137	BUT THOSE ARE COUPLE OF TIMES WHERE I WOULD YOU KNOW BE AH EXITING A LOW SPEED TURN AND THERE WAS YOU KNOW AH A LITTLE DELAY ON FIGURING OUT WHICH GEAR I WANTED TO BE IN UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000138	YOU KNOW LIKE I I WAS OTHER THEN THAT I THINK IT'S A LITTLE SILLY I DON'T LIKE THE FIVE FOOT BED I 
YOU1000000000_S0000139	AND YOU CAN'T GET IF YOU WANT THE CREW FORD CREW CAB LIKE WHAT WE HAVE YOU CAN ONLY GET THE FIVE FOOT BED 
YOU1000000000_S0000140	SO THE WAY THE RANGER WORKS IS IF YOU GET THE SMALLER YOU KNOW EXTRA CAB OR WHATEVER AH YOU YOU GET THE SIX FOOT BED 
YOU1000000000_S0000141	AH IF YOU GET THERE FOUR OR TWO CAB IT'S ONLY THE FIVE OF BED SO YOU DON'T HAVE A THOSE ARE YOUR CHOICES THERE'S NO BED CHOICE 
YOU1000000000_S0000142	WHERE AS TO SAY CHEVROLET COLORADO YOU CAN GET THE LONGER BED WITH THE WITH THE THE BIGGER CAB 
YOU1000000000_S0000143	SO AND THE OTHER THINGS LIKE JUST LIKE THE RUNNING BOARDS ARE JUST PLACED AWKWARDLY THERE'S NO GRABBING ABOARD TO GET IN YOU WANNA PICK UP THAT'S SITS THAT HIGH 
YOU1000000000_S0000144	IT SHOULD BE A GRABBING LUIS IT IS KINDA TALL I NOTICED TOO 
YOU1000000000_S0000145	AH JUST ONE MORE THING ON HANDLING I THOUGHT WAS INTERESTING IS THIS THING FEELS LIKE A MINIATURE F ONE FIFTY 
YOU1000000000_S0000146	IT GOT THIS THAT DULL SLOW KIND OF STEERING IT KINDA JUST DEAD 
YOU1000000000_S0000147	AND THEN WHEN YOU YEAH AND WHEN YOU TURN IT ACTUALLY HAS BODY ROLE LIKE IT KINDA DIVES A LITTLE BIT 
YOU1000000000_S0000148	WHICH INTO THAT KIND OF THAT TRICKY FEEL I DON'T THINK IT'S MAKES THE END OF THE WORLD BUT IT'S IT WAS INTERESTING TO ME THAT IT IT REACTED KINDA LIKE THAT BECAUSE COLORADO IS NOTHING LIKE A SILVERADO 
YOU1000000000_S0000149	RIGHT RIGHT IN MY EYES BUT 
YOU1000000000_S0000150	SO AH YOU KNOW AH KEEP KEEP THE CHECK AND BACK FROM CONSUMER REPORT 
YOU1000000000_S0000151	STILL FRESH WE HAVE THIS IS JUST OUR EARLY IMPRESSIONS 
YOU1000000000_S0000152	WE ARE GONNA HAVE MORE INFORMATION PRETTY SOON WE'RE GONNA HAVE A FIRST DRIVE IN A VIDEO AH WHICH TAKES US TO OUR NEXT SECTION OF QUESTIONS 
YOU1000000000_S0000153	AH PLEASE SEND US YOUR VIDEO AND TEXT QUESTIONS TO TALKING CARS AND ICLOUD DOT COM 
YOU1000000000_S0000154	FIRST UP IS A VIDEO QUESTION ABOUT THE TOYOTA RAV FOUR HYBRID AND LET'S TAKE A LISTEN 
YOU1000000000_S0000155	HELLO C R TEAM I AND MY HUSBAND ARE EXPECTING BABY IN JUNE AND WE'RE IN THE MARKET TO BUY OUR FIRST CAR IN NEXT MONTH OR SO 
YOU1000000000_S0000156	I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT ABOUT TWENTY-NINETEEN RADFORD HYBRID OR WHEEL RIDE SYSTEM 
YOU1000000000_S0000157	I HAVE LEARNED THAT THE REAR IS DISCONNECTED FROM THE FRONT AND THE REAR WHEELS GET POWER FROM THE AUXILIARY BATTERY WHICH GET CHARGED WHEN BRAKES ARE APPLIED 
YOU1000000000_S0000158	DOES THIS MEAN THAT ON A SNOWY HIGHWAY WHEN WE NEED ALL WHEEL ALL WHEEL DRIVE CONSTANTLY 
YOU1000000000_S0000159	WHEN WE ARE DRIVING THIS CAR AT A STEADY PACE WITHOUT USING TOO MUCH BRAKES THEN I'M TURNING INTO RISK OF DEPLETING THE BATTERY 
YOU1000000000_S0000160	AND SOON THE CAR TURNING INTO JUST FRONT WHEEL DRIVE WHAT IS RELIABILITY BATTERY GETTING DISCHARGED COMPLETELY CONSIDERING WE HAVE A LOT OF SNOW IN NORTH EAST CANADA 
YOU1000000000_S0000161	AND SOMETIMES WE MAY NEED ALL THE WHEEL DRIVE FOR FOR LONG PERIOD OF SIX TO SEVEN HOURS AND IF IT'S A BIG PROBLEM THEN SHOULD WE DISREGARD RADFORD HYBRID 
YOU1000000000_S0000162	AND LOOK FOR ALTERNATE HYBRID LIKE ROUGE HYBRID 
YOU1000000000_S0000163	WOW WHAT WHAT A GREAT QUESTION AND CLEARLY SHOWS THAT AH TALKING CARS LISTENERS AND VIEWERS ARE VERY VERY SMART AND HIGHLY EDUCATED 
YOU1000000000_S0000164	SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT HERE UM YEAH SO THE THE NEW RAV FOUR HYBRID IS ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE THE SAME UM HYBRID SYSTEM THAT THEY BEEN THEY'VE BEEN USING THIS HYBRID SYSTEM SINCE THE FIRST HIGHLANDER HYBRID 
YOU1000000000_S0000165	AND I REMEMBER THIS DISTINCTLY BECAUSE I CAN REMEMBER BEING IN A SNOWSTORM WATCHING A HIGHLANDER HYBRID BRAND NEW CAR STUCK FRONT WHEEL DRIVE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS FRONT WHEEL DRIVE UM TRYING TO CLIMB A HILL 
YOU1000000000_S0000166	AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE THIS CAR HAS A A GASOLINE ENGINE AND IT'S FRONT IT'S TECHNICALLY A FRONT WHEEL DRIVE CAR AND THE HYBRID SYSTEM IS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE UNIT IN THE REAR 
YOU1000000000_S0000167	UM BATTERIES ELECTRIC MOTORS SEPARATELY CONTROLLED AT THE REAR NOW UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000168	IN IN THEORY THEY THEY SAY THIS THING YOU KNOW WHEN YOU TAKE OFF IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU POWER YOU KNOW 
YOU1000000000_S0000169	THAT THE REAL WHEEL THIS SENSES SLIP AND THEN GONNA HELP YOU GO OVER TIME THOUGH YOU CAN DRAIN THAT BATTERY DOWN 
YOU1000000000_S0000170	AND YOU ARE LEFT WITH A POTENTIALLY A FRONT DRIVE VEHICLE 
YOU1000000000_S0000171	RIGHT I MEAN AH AH AND JUST TO DO A CONTRAST AS OPPOSE TO A TRADITIONAL 
YOU1000000000_S0000172	ALL WHEEL DRIVE IT WILL DRIVE IT JUST HAVE A BIG DRIVE CHEVROLET RIGHT WHERE YOU CAN LOCK EVERYTHING UP 
YOU1000000000_S0000173	EXACTLY UM AND IT'S IT'S A NEAT IT'S A NEAT IDEA BUT I MEAN I HAVE SEEN THIS THING STRUGGLE 
YOU1000000000_S0000174	AND THIS THIS GREEN TECHNOLOGY THE BRAND NEW TWENTY NINETEEN RAV FOUR IS GONNA HAVE THIS SAME UM THE SYSTEM IN IT 
YOU1000000000_S0000175	SO FOR HER SHE REALLY WEIGHING HEAVILY ON HAVING ALL WHEEL DRIVE THAT I WOULDN'T USE THIS AS A UM YOU KNOW SUBSTITUTE FOR THAT 
YOU1000000000_S0000176	UM AT THE SAME TIME YOU YOU YOU DON'T NEED ALL WHEEL DRIVE ALL THE TIME EVEN IN THE SNOW 
YOU1000000000_S0000177	IF IF IF YOU KNOW AH SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S MOSTLY CONCERNED ABOUT BEING YOU KNOW HIGHWAY DRIVES IN SNOW 
YOU1000000000_S0000178	WELL YOU KNOW HOPEFULLY SHE HAS FORD FORD SNOW TIRES CAUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IF IF SHE DRIVES THEM IN A LOT OF SNOW 
YOU1000000000_S0000179	SHE SHOULD HAVE FORD SNOW TIRES AND THEN EVEN IF IT WAS ONLY FRONT WHEEL DRIVE SHE IN MOST CASES STILL BE FINE AND KEEP IN MIND THIS SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED TO BE IN FRONT DRIVE 
YOU1000000000_S0000180	AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR EFFICIENCY SO THEREFORE AH IT'S ONLY FOR THE MOST PART IT'S ONLY GONNA SWITCH TO AH TO ALL WHEEL DRIVE 
YOU1000000000_S0000181	WHEN IT LIKE YOU SAID IT'S SENSES SLIP SO A LOT OF THE TIME EVEN IN SNOW SHE'S GONNA BE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY 
YOU1000000000_S0000182	IT'S GONNA WANNA BE IN FRONT WHEEL DRIVE ANY WAY UNTIL IT SENSES THAT SLIP SO BUT BUT EVEN THEN REALLY THE MORE IMPORTANT THING 
YOU1000000000_S0000183	IS AH AH IS SNOW TIRES BUT UNLESS SHE'S AH YOU KNOW SHE'S MIGHT NOTICE A PROBLEM ON YOU KNOW STEEP UP HILLS 
YOU1000000000_S0000184	ON THE HIGHWAY OR EVEN MORE SO ON BACK ROADS IS REALLY WHERE THIS GONNA POTENTIALLY BE A PROBLEM 
YOU1000000000_S0000185	IF THAT BATTERY WORK IF SHE WERE TO BE UNLUCKY THE THE BATTERY IS DRAINED WHEN SHE'S TRYING TO GO UP A STEEP SLIPPERY UP 
YOU1000000000_S0000186	AND HAVING HAVING A NEW A NEW KID IN I MEAN AH AH MAYBE I'LL I'LL BE NERVOUS TO TELL HER THAT THIS IS GOOD IDEA 
YOU1000000000_S0000187	SO YOU COULD SAY WELL YOU KNOW SO SHE'S THINKING ABOUT ANOTHER HYBRID AH YOU KNOW THE NISSAN ROGUE HYBRID 
YOU1000000000_S0000188	BUT THE PROMISE WITH A LOT OF THESE HYBRIDS THEY'RE GONNA WORK YOU KNOW THEY THEY YEAH THEY BECOME ALL WHEEL DRIVE IN SAME SIMILAR WAY 
YOU1000000000_S0000189	SO MAYBE A HYBRID IS ALL WHEEL DRIVE IS NOT HER BEST CHOICE 
YOU1000000000_S0000190	AH AN ALTERNATIVE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT IS IS YOU KNOW ONE OF CONSUMER REPORTS TOP RATED VEHICLES THE SCIMBER FORESTER 
YOU1000000000_S0000191	UM WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE ALL WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM AH KIND OF YOU KNOW SAYING BYE BYE 
YOU1000000000_S0000192	WHEN AND YOU YOU USING IT A LOT SO 
YOU1000000000_S0000193	IT'S NOT GONNA BE AS EFFICIENT BUT IT'S STILL QUIET EFFICIENT 
YOU1000000000_S0000195	THE EFFICIENCY OR DO YOU WANT THE SAFETY OF BEING STUCK 
YOU1000000000_S0000196	NOW SHE HAS NO MORE AH WORRIES ABOUT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE AUTO DRIVE SYSTEM NOT BEING THERE WHEN SHE NEEDS IT 
YOU1000000000_S0000197	THANKS YOUR QUESTION VERY STILL YOU CLEARLY KNOW YOUR CARS AND NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE ONTO THE NEXT ONE WHICH IS GETTING A USED EZ AND WINTER DRIVING 
YOU1000000000_S0000198	THE QUESTION READS I LIVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND LOOKING TO GET AN E V CAR I'M LOOKING AT A USED B M W I THREE 
YOU1000000000_S0000199	A USED TESLA MODEL S OR NEW MODEL THREE OF ALL WHEEL DRIVE 
YOU1000000000_S0000200	HOW DOES AN E V REAR WHEEL DRIVE HANDLE THE SNOW WITH SNOW TIRES OF COURSE THANK YOU C R FOR TEACHING ME ABOUT SNOW TIRES 
YOU1000000000_S0000201	I NORMALLY THINK BEST TO WORSE ALL WHEEL DRIVE FRONT WHEEL DRIVE 
YOU1000000000_S0000202	REAR AND REAR WHEEL DRIVE WITH INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE CARS WHERE WOULD AN E V REAR WHEEL DRIVE FIT INTO THAT LINEUP 
YOU1000000000_S0000203	SO RYAN TIRE MAN TELL US PROS AND CONS 
YOU1000000000_S0000204	THIS IS THIS IS A AN INTERESTING QUESTION BECAUSE UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000206	IT'S NOT EASY ANSWER UM THE FIRST THING THAT COMES TO MIND IS HIS HE SAYS THAT HE LIVES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE 
YOU1000000000_S0000207	IT'S COLD THERE YOU KNOW MY FIRST MY MY FIRST RESERVATION WOULD BE HAVING ELECTRIC CAR IN A COLD CLIMATE 
YOU1000000000_S0000208	RIGHT CAUSE IT WOULD DRIVE YOU NUTS YOU LOSE A LOT OF UM RANGE RIGHT UM THE BATTERIES WORST KIND OF MUSICAL 
YOU1000000000_S0000209	WE DID A STORY ON THIS RECENTLY 
YOU1000000000_S0000210	FIRST ISSUE UM BUT GOING BACK TO WHAT HE'S SAYING I'M HUNDRED PERCENT YOU HAVE HAVE SNOW TIRES UM A REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR IS GOING TO 
YOU1000000000_S0000211	THE REAR WHEEL DRIVE ELECTRIC CAR BECAUSE YOU HAVE ELECTRIC MOTORS THEY HAVE REGENERATIVE BRAKING 
YOU1000000000_S0000212	MY CONCERN WOULD BE WHEN YOU LIFT OF THE THROTTLE WILL YOU HAVE TO GET USED TO IT WHEN YOU LIFT OF THE THROTTLE IT'S GONNA BE IT'S ESSENTIALLY DRAGGING AT THE REAR END YOU'RE CREATING A ROOM 
YOU1000000000_S0000213	WHICH IS A WEIRD FEELING ON A DRY SURFACE 
YOU1000000000_S0000214	DRY ROAD RIGHT AND NOW IF IT'S A SLIPPERY SURFACE EXCUSE ME THEY DIVER THEY GONNA THEY ARE GONNA BE DRAGGING AND IF IT'S REALLY SLIPPERY THE STABILITY CONTROL THE CARS CAN DO A LOT OF WORK 
YOU1000000000_S0000215	NOW YOU ARE NOT GONNA GET SPIN OUT OF CONTROL WE HAVE YOU KNOW MODERN STABILITY CONTROL IS VERY GOOD SPECIALLY IN THESE CARS BUT UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000216	IS IT GONNA GO IN THE SNOW ABSOLUTELY I THINK THERE IS GONNA BE SOME LEARNING CURVE THERE LIKE DRIVING IT SMOOTHLY AND NOT DEALING WITH ALL THE YOU KNOW THE THE THE STABILITY CONTROL GOING CRAZY UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000217	HE'S RIGHT I MEAN ALL REAR WHEEL CAR IS PROBABLY YOUR BEST BET WITH SNOW TIRES OF COURSE UM 
YOU1000000000_S0000218	WHEN IT COME TO FRONT REAR DRIVE IT'S PREFERENCE I MEAN I DROVE A B M W FOR YEARS WITH SUZAN BAG AND SNOW TIRES AND I WENT ANYWHERE I NEEDED TO GO 
YOU1000000000_S0000219	BUT I PREFERRED THAT UM FOR THE AVERAGE DRIVER MAYBE FRONT WHEEL DRIVES A LITTLE BIT BETTER WITH SNOW TIRES UM THAT'S PREFERENCE 
YOU1000000000_S0000220	I I THINK FRONT WHEEL DRIVE IS EASIER TO CONTROL FOR MOST DRIVERS BECAUSE AH YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT POWER AH POWER ON OVERSTEER LIKE YOU DO WITH THE WHEEL DRIVE CAR REAR WHEEL DRIVE CAR IS DEFINITELY MORE FUN 
YOU1000000000_S0000221	BUT WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT FRONT WHEEL DRIVE CARS IS YOU'RE ASKING YOU KNOW THE AH THE FRONT WHEELS TO DO TWO THING BOTH POWER AND DRIVE THE CARS 
YOU1000000000_S0000222	YOU KNOW POWER THE CAR FORWARDS AND ALSO STEER THE CAR AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT 
YOU1000000000_S0000223	YOU KNOW A REAR WHEEL DRIVE CARS BUT I THINK THE BIGGER QUESTION IS WHY DOES THIS PERSON WANT YOU KNOW IS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON HE'S LOOKING FOR A REAR WHEEL DRIVE 
YOU1000000000_S0000224	AH AND IF THAT'S THE CASE IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THEN YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT THE REAR DRIVE BECAUSE YOU FIND THAT MORE FUN TO DRIVE THEN GO FOR 
YOU1000000000_S0000225	BUT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW AH YOU COULD GO WITH A LITTLE NEWER TESLA 
YOU1000000000_S0000226	AND YOU KNOW AH AND GET ALL WHEEL DRIVE SO THAT'S ANOTHER OPTION 
YOU1000000000_S0000227	BUT THE THE MOST THE INTERESTING THING ABOUT THESE ELECTRIC CARS THOUGH IS I I LOOKED UP THE WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION AND IT'S ACTUALLY AH NOT BAD 
YOU1000000000_S0000228	I MEAN SO FOR INSTANCE THE I THREE IS FIFTY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE WEIGHT IS TO THE REAR THIS THIS IS YOU KNOW AH OUR OUR TESTING 
YOU1000000000_S0000229	AH THE MODEL S REAR DRIVE WAS FIFTY-THREE PERCENT TO THE REAR MODEL THREE FIFTY-TWO PERCENT 
YOU1000000000_S0000230	SO WE PUT OUR SKILL THE POINT IS THERE'S SOME WEIGHT BACK THERE YOU KNOW A LOT OF CARS ARE IN A LOT OF REAR WHEEL DRIVE CARS IN FIFTY-FIFTY 
YOU1000000000_S0000231	SO YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT MORE WEIGHT OVER THE REAR TO GIVE YOU SOME TRACTION BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS WITH SNOW TIRES AND A B S 
YOU1000000000_S0000232	AH TRACTION CONTROL AND ELECTRONIC STILL STABILITY CONTROL YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE EVEN WITH REAR WHEEL DRIVE 
YOU1000000000_S0000233	RIGHT I I WAS GONNA MAKE THE ARGUE THE FRONT WHEEL DRIVE THE WEIGHT IS OVER THE DRIVE WHEEL 
YOU1000000000_S0000234	SO IN SLIPPERY CONDITIONS THAT'S THAT'S USUALLY GETS COMPLICATED 
YOU1000000000_S0000235	IF THAT'S THE BECAUSE BECAUSE THE WEIGHT TRANSFER GOES REAR WERE 
YOU1000000000_S0000236	THANKS SO MUCH FOR YOUR QUESTION KINDA BRINGS US TO OUR FINAL ONE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE GOTTA RAP THIS UP AH THE QUESTION READS 
YOU1000000000_S0000237	LOVE YOUR SHOW I DRIVE A TWENTY-EIGHTEEN ACCORD E X L AND LOVE ALL THE DRIVERS SYSTEM 
YOU1000000000_S0000238	I DROVE THE CAR IN LIGHT SNOW AND AFTER TEN MINUTES I GOT A MESSAGE ON THE SCREEN THAT THE RADAR IS OBSTRUCTED 
YOU1000000000_S0000239	MEANING NO DRIVER ASSIST THAT YOU'RE PROBABLY SEEING ON YOUR SCREEN RIGHT NOW WHAT CAN ONE CONCLUDE FROM THAT ABOUT SELF DRIVING CARS IN THE WINTER 
YOU1000000000_S0000241	EXACTLY OUR CONCERN ALL OF THIS TECHNOLOGY THAT'S WHY SELF DRIVING CARS AREN'T HERE YET 
YOU1000000000_S0000242	ONE OF THE REAL SENSORS SENSORS IS A BROAD TERM THERE'S THERE'S ALL DIFFERENT TYPES OF SENSORS THERE'S OPTICAL UM THERE'S AH YOU KNOW EYESIGHT AH THERE'S SONAR THERE'S ALL KIND OF SENSORS

YOU1000000002_S0000001	THE WUHAN CORONAVIRUS BEGAN LIKE ALL NEW VIRUSES WITH A REMARKABLY ORDINARY MOMENT 
YOU1000000002_S0000002	IN LATE NOVEMBER TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN SOMEONE IT IS NOT YET KNOWN WHO ATE A WILD ANIMAL THAT BY CHANCE CARRIED THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS 
YOU1000000002_S0000003	AND DAYS LATER STARTED TO FEEL THE SYMPTOMS OF WHAT INITIALLY SEEMED LIKE A BAD COLD 
YOU1000000002_S0000004	FROM THERE MORE INDIVIDUALS WERE INFECTED AT FIRST THROUGH THE CONSUMPTION OF OTHER WILD ANIMALS BUT LATER THROUGH DIRECT HUMAN TO HUMAN TRANSMISSION 
YOU1000000002_S0000005	FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF DECEMBER THE VIRUS WAS THERE IN WUHAN SPREADING BUT NOBODY KNEW IT 
YOU1000000002_S0000006	THE CASES PRESENTING AS PNEUMONIA WERE AT FIRST CONSIDERED TO BE CAUSED BY ANYONE OF THE COUNTLESS OTHER VIRUSES THAT CAN CREATE SUCH SYMPTOMS 
YOU1000000002_S0000007	EVENTUALLY THE ESCALATION IN CASES AND EFFECT THAT ALMOST ALL THE FIRST PATIENTS HAD BOUGHT FOOD AT ONE PARTICULAR WILD ANIMAL MARKET CAUGHT THE WUHAN CITY GOVERNMENT'S ATTENTION 
YOU1000000002_S0000008	THE FIRST OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION THAT SOMETHING WAS UP CAME ON NEW YEAR'S EVE 
YOU1000000002_S0000009	DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST WHEN THE MUNICIPAL HEALTH COMMISSION PUBLISHED A PRESS RELEASE ACKNOWLEDGING THE SITUATION 
YOU1000000002_S0000010	OVER A MONTH AFTER THE FIRST TRANSMISSION AT THE TIME THIS WAS SMALL LOCAL NEWS 
YOU1000000002_S0000011	ONLY A FEW DOZEN CASES OF PNEUMONIA IN A CITY OF MILLIONS IN A COUNTRY OF A BILLION 
YOU1000000002_S0000012	BUT THEN CAME THE NEWS THAT THIS WAS NOT ONE OF THE MANY PRE-EXISTING PNEUMONIA CAUSING VIRUSES 
YOU1000000002_S0000013	THIS WAS SOMETHING NEW WESTERN MEDIA FIRST REPORTED ON THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS AROUND JANUARY EIGHTH 
YOU1000000002_S0000014	THE NEW YORK TIMES FOREBODINGLY WROTE THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE NEW VIRUS IS READILY SPREAD BY HUMANS AND IT HAS NOT BEEN TIED TO ANY DEATHS 
YOU1000000002_S0000015	THAT WOULD SOON CHANGE 
YOU1000000002_S0000016	ON JANUARY TWENTY FIRST WHEN THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION STARTED TRACKING THE OUTBREAK THERE WERE TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO CASES 
YOU1000000002_S0000017	THE NEXT DAY THREE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN THE NEXT FIVE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE 
YOU1000000002_S0000018	THEN EIGHT HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX THEN ONE THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY 
YOU1000000002_S0000019	THEN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN AND BY THE START OF THE WEEK OF JANUARY TWENTY SIXTH IT WAS CLEAR THAT THIS WOULD NOT BE A QUICK AND PAINLESS VIRUS 
YOU1000000002_S0000020	THIS WOULD BE ONE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS AND IT WAS GOING TO GET A LOT WORSE BEFORE IT GOT ANY BETTER 
YOU1000000002_S0000021	DRASTIC CIRCUMSTANCES CALLED FOR DRASTIC ACTION IT WAS CLEAR GIVEN THE TRENDS THAT WUHAN'S HOSPITALS WOULD SOON BE OVERWHELMED BY PATIENTS 
YOU1000000002_S0000022	AND IN THE CASE OF HIGHLY INFECTIOUS VIRUSES LIKE CORONAVIRUS THAT MAKES A BAD SITUATION WORSE AS INFECTED INDIVIDUALS WILL TRY TO RECOVER AT HOME 
YOU1000000002_S0000023	WHERE THE VIRUS CAN MORE EASILY SPREAD THEREFORE THE DECISION WAS MADE ON JANUARY TWENTY-THIRD TO BUILD A BRAND NEW FACILITY CAPABLE OF TREATING ONE THOUSAND PATIENTS AT ONCE 
YOU1000000002_S0000024	HUOSHENSHAN HOSPITAL IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THIS WOULD BE DONE FULLY CONSTRUCTED BY FEBRUARY SECOND 
YOU1000000002_S0000025	JUST TEN DAYS LATER 
YOU1000000002_S0000026	CHINA HAS EXPERIENCED WITH SUCH A FEAT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THE COUNTRY SUFFERED AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME OR SARS WHICH IS ALSO CAUSED BY A FORM OF CORONAVIRUS 
YOU1000000002_S0000027	MUCH LIKE WITH THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS HOSPITALS WERE OVERWHELMED AND MANY HAD TO TURN AWAY PATIENTS 
YOU1000000002_S0000028	IN RESPONSE THE GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO BUILD A NEW HOSPITAL 
YOU1000000002_S0000029	OVER SIX DAYS SEVEN THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION WORKERS BROUGHT THE XIAOTANGSHAN HOSPITAL INTO REALITY AND IT QUICKLY BEGAN ACCEPTING PATIENTS AND RELIEVING THE OVERSTRESSED MEDICAL SYSTEM 
YOU1000000002_S0000030	ONCE THE OUTBREAK SETTLED DOWN THE XIAOTANGSHAN HOSPITAL WAS HAILED AS A MASSIVE SUCCESS BY BOTH THE COUNTRY ITSELF AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 
YOU1000000002_S0000031	THE STATISTICS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES OVERALL SARS HAD A FATALITY RATE OF NINE POINT SIX PERCENT 
YOU1000000002_S0000032	AT THE XIAOTANGSHAN HOSPITAL JUST ONE POINT TWO PERCENT OF PATIENTS DIED 
YOU1000000002_S0000033	AND NOT A SINGLE STAFF MEMBER WAS INFECTED 
YOU1000000002_S0000034	IT'S NO WONDER WHY CHINA WANTED TO REPLICATE THIS 
YOU1000000002_S0000035	AND THEREFORE XIAOTANGSHAN WAS THE MODEL FOR THE NEW CORONAVIRUS HOSPITAL BUT THIS TIME WOULD BE DIFFERENT 
YOU1000000002_S0000036	THE TWO THOUSAND THREE HOSPITAL BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OVER SIX MONTHS AFTER THE BEGINNING OF THE OUTBREAK 
YOU1000000002_S0000037	THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY HOSPITAL STARTED CONSTRUCTION LESS THAN TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST CASE AND JUST DAYS AFTER THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OUTBREAK BECAME CLEAR 
YOU1000000002_S0000038	THERE WAS FAR LESS TIME FOR PLANNING AND DESIGN THE ORDERS CAME AND THEN IT WAS IMMEDIATELY TIME TO START 
YOU1000000002_S0000039	STEP ONE WAS FINDING A PLACE TO PUT THE HOSPITAL 
YOU1000000002_S0000040	THE LOCATION SELECTED WAS PREVIOUSLY JUST AN OPEN FIELD ABOUT FOURTEEN MILES OR TWENTY-TWO KILOMETERS FROM CENTRAL WUHAN 
YOU1000000002_S0000041	THIS KEPT IT AWAY FROM THE DENSE URBAN CORE WHERE FURTHER TRANSMISSION MIGHT BE EASIER BUT THE FIELD IN QUESTION WAS ALSO RIGHT OFF A LARGE PRE-EXISTING ROAD WHICH MADE ACCESS EASY 
YOU1000000002_S0000042	THAT ROAD WAS QUICKLY SHUT DOWN AND TURNED INTO ESSENTIALLY A PARKING LOT AND STAGING AREA FOR THE PROJECT 
YOU1000000002_S0000043	THE CONTRACT FOR THIS PROJECT WAS GIVEN TO CHINA CONSTRUCTION THIRD ENGINEERING BUREAU COMPANY A SUBSIDIARY OF THE STATE-OWNED CHINA STATE CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING CORPORATION 
YOU1000000002_S0000044	BY REVENUE THIS IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST CONSTRUCTION COMPANY AND IT HAS EXPERIENCE IN ENORMOUS PROJECTS LIKE BEIJING'S NEW AIRPORT EGYPT'S NEW CAPITAL CITY AND TESLA SHANGHAI GIGA FACTORY 
YOU1000000002_S0000045	IF ANYONE WAS GOING TO PULL THIS OFF IT WAS THEM 
YOU1000000002_S0000046	TO BEGIN CONSTRUCTION IN EARNEST THEY FIRST NEEDED TO PREPARE THE SELECTED SITE 
YOU1000000002_S0000047	THAT INVOLVED FIRST CUTTING DOWN ALL THE TREES AND SHRUBBERY AND THEN PERFECTLY LEVELLING THE GROUND 
YOU1000000002_S0000048	OUT OF THE TEN DAY CONSTRUCTION TIMELINE THIS TOOK LONGER THAN ONE MIGHT THINK 
YOU1000000002_S0000049	ABOUT FORTY-EIGHT HOURS 
YOU1000000002_S0000050	THIS WAS DUE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT THE PROJECT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERSTAFFED IN ITS FIRST FEW DAYS 
YOU1000000002_S0000051	AS THEY SCRAMBLED TO FIND WORKERS ESPECIALLY AS IT'S START COINCIDED WITH THE CHINESE NEW YEARS 
YOU1000000002_S0000052	ONCE THE LAND WAS LEVEL THOUGH THEY MOVED ON TO CONSTRUCTING THE BUILDING FOUNDATIONS BY SUNDAY JANUARY TWENTY-SIXTH 
YOU1000000002_S0000053	FOR THIS THEY USED A LAYERED SYSTEM 
YOU1000000002_S0000054	ON THE BOTTOM AT EIGHT INCH OR TWENTY CENTIMETER LAYER OF SAND WAS PLACED THEN WHAT'S REFERRED TO AS A GEOTEXTILE LAYER 
YOU1000000002_S0000055	A FORMAL FABRIC THEN A LAYER OF WATERPROOF PLASTIC THEN ANOTHER OF GEOTEXTILE LAYER THEN ANOTHER LAYER OF SAND 
YOU1000000002_S0000056	ON THAT THEY THEN POURED CONCRETE WHICH DRIED OVER A FEW DAYS 
YOU1000000002_S0000057	BUT THEN CAME THE TRULY IMPRESSIVE ELEMENT 
YOU1000000002_S0000058	CONSTRUCTING THE BUILDINGS THEMSELVES IN A MATTER OF DAYS 
YOU1000000002_S0000059	WHAT MADE THIS POSSIBLE WAS THE USE OF PRE-FABRICATED ELEMENTS 
YOU1000000002_S0000060	MODULAR CONSTRUCTION SUCH AS THIS HAS BEEN ON THE RISE RECENTLY 
YOU1000000002_S0000061	IT'S NOW A WELL ESTABLISH TECHNIQUE FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS LARGE AND SMALL 
YOU1000000002_S0000062	THE IDEA IS SIMPLY THAT SOMEWHERE OFFSITE IN NUMBER OF IDENTICAL BUILDING ELEMENTS ARE BUILT 
YOU1000000002_S0000063	THEN THEY'RE SHIPPED TO THE CONSTRUCTION SITE AND PUT TOGETHER 
YOU1000000002_S0000064	THIS HAS PLENTY OF ADVANTAGES 
YOU1000000002_S0000065	FIRST AND FOREMOST THE USE OF IDENTICAL ELEMENTS BUILT IN A FACTORY SYSTEM TO CONSTRUCT A LARGER BUILDING LOWERS COST THROUGH ECONOMIES OF SCALE 
YOU1000000002_S0000066	THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GET TO PUTTING THE BUILDING TOGETHER ON SITE CONSTRUCTION TIME IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS 
YOU1000000002_S0000067	WHICH ONCE AGAIN LOWERS COST 
YOU1000000002_S0000068	IN THIS CASE THOUGH COST WAS NOT THE PRIMARY CONCERN 
YOU1000000002_S0000069	SPEED WAS AND MODULAR CONSTRUCTION IS THE FASTEST WAY TO BUILD 
YOU1000000002_S0000070	MOST OF THESE SITE USED A TYPE OF PREFABRICATED MODULAR CONSTRUCTION COMMON WITH TEMPORARY BUILDINGS 
YOU1000000002_S0000071	WHILE IT'S NOT CLEAR WHICH COMPANY PRODUCE THE PREFABRICATED COMPONENTS IT IS CLEAR THAT THEY EXISTED BEFORE THE PROJECT STARTED 
YOU1000000002_S0000072	THE FIRST BUILDING ELEMENTS STARTED COMING TOGETHER ON MONDAY JANUARY TWENTY-SEVENTH JUST FOUR DAYS AFTER THE PROJECT BROKE GROUNDS 
YOU1000000002_S0000073	THEY BEGAN BY BUILDING THE SKELETON ON THE MODULAR UNITS 
YOU1000000002_S0000074	EACH OF THESE UNITS WAS ABOUT THE SHAPE AND SIZE OF A TWENTY FOOT SHIPPING CONTAINER 
YOU1000000002_S0000075	AND THIS SKELETON FORM INCLUDED JUST THE FLOOR CEILING AND STRUCTURAL SUPPORTS AT EACH CORNER 
YOU1000000002_S0000076	THROUGHOUT THIS ALL SEPARATE TEAMS OUT OF THE THOUSANDS OF WORKERS THERE STARTED TO HOOK THE SITE UP TO UTILITIES LIKE SEWAGE WATER ELECTRICITY AND INTERNET 
YOU1000000002_S0000077	MUCH OF THIS JUST INVOLVED BRINGING IN THE STATE-OWNED COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE BUT FOR INTERNET AND THE SUBSEQUENT BUILDING OUT OF AN IT SYSTEM PRIVATE COMPANIES LIKE HUAWEI AND LENOVO GOT INVOLVED 
YOU1000000002_S0000078	THIS WAS NO DOUBT PARTIALLY BECAUSE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THIS HOSPITAL DREW CONSIDERABLE PUBLIC ATTENTION IN CHINA 
YOU1000000002_S0000079	IT CAME TO REPRESENT THE PHYSICAL MANIFESTATION OF THE COUNTRY'S RESPONSE TO THE CRISIS AND ALSO OF CHINA'S ENGINEERING MIGHT 
YOU1000000002_S0000080	THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS ITSELF WAS STREAMED BY STATE-OWNED BROADCASTING COMPANIES AND UP TO EIGHTEEN MILLION CONCURRENT VIEWERS WATCHED THE PROCESS 
YOU1000000002_S0000081	NEARLY EVERY MAJOR BROADCASTER IN CHINA REPORTING FROM THE SITE PUBLISHING FOOTAGE LIKE WHAT YOU'RE SEEING NOW ALTHOUGH VERY FEW WESTERN BROADCASTERS WERE THERE 
YOU1000000002_S0000082	THIS IS PART OF THE REASON LIMITED DETAILED INFORMATION AND FOOTAGE OF THE CONSTRUCTION EXISTS OUTSIDE OF CHINA STATE-OWNED BROADCASTS 
YOU1000000002_S0000083	WHERE THE GOVERNMENT CAN MANAGE THE STORY AND WHAT GETS OUT 
YOU1000000002_S0000084	IT WAS NO DOUBT VIEWED AS AN OPPORTUNITY BY THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN A TIME WHEN THEY FACED INTENSE CRITICISM FOR ITS INITIAL RESPONSE TO THE OUTBREAK 
YOU1000000002_S0000085	BUT OF COURSE TO GAIN THAT PRAISE THE PROJECT NEEDED TO BE SUCCESSFUL 
YOU1000000002_S0000086	ON TUESDAY JANUARY TWENTY-EIGHTH SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE FIRST BUILDING WERE COMPLETED WHILE THE REST OF THE COMPLEXES FOUNDATIONS WERE FINISHING UP 
YOU1000000002_S0000087	OVER THE TWENTY-NINTH AND THIRTIETH MORE OF THE OVERALL STRUCTURE CAME TO BE AS THE WALLS WERE INSTALLED ON AND IN THE SKELETONS OF BUILDINGS AND WORK THEN BEGAN ON TURNING THESE EMPTY BUILDINGS INTO A HOSPITAL 
YOU1000000002_S0000088	EACH PATIENT ROOM WAS OUTFITTED WITH TWO BEDS SOME MEDICAL EQUIPMENT AND A BATHROOM 
YOU1000000002_S0000089	CONSIDERING THE HOSPITAL IS BUILT WITH QUARANTINE IN MIND THERE ARE SOME UNIQUE ASPECTS TO THE DESIGN OF THESE ROOMS 
YOU1000000002_S0000090	FOR ONE THE VENTILATION SYSTEM IS BUILT TO KEEP A NEGATIVE PRESSURE IN ALL QUARANTINE AREAS SO THAT AIR WILL GO OUT THROUGH AN EXHAUST SYSTEM RATHER THAN OUT UNDER THE DOOR INTO THE REST OF THE HOSPITAL 
YOU1000000002_S0000091	WHILE AT THE TIME OF WRITING IT'S NOT ENTIRELY KNOWN TO WHAT EXTENT THIS CORONAVIRUS CAN SPREAD THROUGH AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION A VENTILATION SYSTEM LIKE THIS IS STANDARD PRACTICE FOR ANY QUARANTINE WARD 
YOU1000000002_S0000092	IN ADDITION TO INDIVIDUAL PATIENT ROOMS SEPARATE AREAS WERE DESIGNED FOR PATIENT PROCESSING DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS LIKE C T SCANNERS WERE INSTALLED AND OTHER CRUCIAL ASPECTS LIKE OFFICES BREAKROOMS AND CANTEENS WERE BUILT IN 
YOU1000000002_S0000093	OVER THE THIRTY-FIRST OF JANUARY AND FIRST AND SECOND OF FEBRUARY THE FINAL AREAS OF THE COMPLEX WERE BUILT UP THE INTERIOR INSTALLATION WAS WRAPPED UP AND ALL THE SYSTEMS WERE TESTED TO ENSURE THAT THE HOSPITAL WAS READY TO BRING IN PATIENTS 
YOU1000000002_S0000094	MEANWHILE EIGHT PEOPLE'S LIBERATION ARMY TRANSPORT PLANES LANDED AT WUHAN AIRPORT CARRYING THE MILITARY MEDICAL STAFF WHO WOULD STAFF THE HOSPITAL 
YOU1000000002_S0000095	THEY MOVED INTO THE FACILITY THROUGHOUT THE SAME DAY FEBRUARY SECOND THEN THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WORKERS PUT THE FINISHING TOUCHES ONTO THE HUNDREDS OF ROOMS 
YOU1000000002_S0000096	THEN THE NEXT MORNING THE MOMENT THAT TEN DAYS PRIOR SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE ARRIVED 
YOU1000000002_S0000097	THE FIRST PATIENTS TRANSFERRED FROM OTHER FACILITIES WERE WHEELED INTO HUOSHENSHAN HOSPITAL AND THUS MARKED THE BEGINNING OF ITS OPERATIONS 
YOU1000000002_S0000098	THEY STARTED WITH JUST A FEW DOZEN PATIENTS BUT IN A MATTER OF DAYS THIS BALLOONED TO HUNDREDS 
YOU1000000002_S0000099	HUOSHENSHAN HOSPITAL WAS ONLY THE START OF CHINA'S PLAN TO RAMP UP THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE BEDS IN WUHAN 
YOU1000000002_S0000100	JUST THREE DAYS AFTER HUOSHENSHAN'S OPENING ANOTHER EVEN LARGER HOSPITAL CALLED LEISHENSHAN OPENED 
YOU1000000002_S0000101	IT'S SIXTEEN HUNDRED BEDS AND THIRTY-TWO WARDS WERE BUILT IN JUST TWELVE DAYS 
YOU1000000002_S0000102	MEANWHILE OTHER HOSPITALS WERE CONVERTED TO ISOLATE AND TREAT CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS AND STADIUMS AND EXHIBITION CENTERS WERE TURNED INTO HOSPITALS AS WELL 
YOU1000000002_S0000103	STILL THOUGH EVEN WITH THIS SWIFT DECISIVE ACTION REPORTS INDICATE THAT MANY OF THOSE WITH MILDER CASES OF CORONAVIRUS ARE GETTING TURNED AWAY FROM HOSPITALS IN WUHAN 
YOU1000000002_S0000104	IT UNFORTUNATELY SEEMS THAT CORONAVIRUS WITH ITS TREMENDOUS SEVERITY IS ONE OF THE FEW THINGS THAT CAN OUTPACE CHINA

YOU1000000008_S0000022	SO THAT'S THINGS LIKE LIGHT CHANGING OUTSIDE OR CLOUDS COMING OVER TRUCKS OR PLANES MAKING A HEAP OF NOISE 
YOU1000000008_S0000023	YOU WANNA TRY AND PICK SOMEWHERE NICE AND QUITE WHERE YOU CAN JUST FOCUS ON DELIVERING THE CONTENT 
YOU1000000008_S0000024	YOU ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT PICKING A LOCATION THAT IS DISTRACTING FOR YOUR VIEWERS YOU WANT YOUR VIEWERS TO FOCUS ON YOU AND THE CONTENT YOU'RE DELIVERING AND NOT BEING DISTRACTED WITH WHAT'S GOING ON BEHIND YOU 
YOU1000000008_S0000025	STEP NUMBER THREE IS TO TEST YOUR INTERNET BEFORE YOU GO LIVE IT'S A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO AT LEAST HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW GOOD OR HOW BAD YOUR INTERNET IS 
YOU1000000008_S0000026	SO IF YOU HEAD OVER TO SPEED TEST DOT NET OR YOU CAN DOWNLOAD THE APP FOR YOUR IPHONE OR FOR YOUR ANDROID DEVICE AND RUN A SPEED TEST FOR THE INTERNET CONNECTION THAT YOU'RE CONNECTED TO 
YOU1000000008_S0000027	THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HERE IS THAT NUMBER ONE THAT THE INTERNET YOU'VE GOT IS STABLE AND THAT THAT LITTLE SPEED TEST ISN'T BOUNCING AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE 
YOU1000000008_S0000028	BUT ALSO YOU WANNA FOCUS ON YOUR UPLOAD SPEED TOO YEAH UPLOAD SPEED IS WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE NOT SO MUCH YOUR DOWNLOAD SPEED 
YOU1000000008_S0000029	AND YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT IDEALLY YOU'VE GOT AT LEAST TWO TO TWO POINT FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND UPLOAD 
YOU1000000008_S0000030	IF YOU'VE GOT TWO TO TWO POINT FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND UPLOAD THEN THAT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR FACEBOOK LIVE BUT YOU DO NEED TO BE AWARE OF OTHER PEOPLE THAT ARE SHARING THE SAME INTERNET CONNECTION 
YOU1000000008_S0000031	IF YOU'RE ON AN OFFICE WI-FI OR WORK CONNECTION OTHER PEOPLE MAY START DOWNLOADING FILES AND KILL THE INTERNET FOR YOU 
YOU1000000008_S0000032	SO YOU WANNA RUN A FEW TESTS NOT JUST ONE RUN A FEW IDEALLY FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THEN A FEW MINUTES OUT AS WELL 
YOU1000000008_S0000033	SO THEN YOU CAN REALLY GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE YOUR INTERNET SPEED IS AT NOW IF YOUR INTERNET SPEED IS LESS THAN TWO TO TWO POINT FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND THEN YOU'VE GOT TWO OPTIONS 
YOU1000000008_S0000034	YOU CAN EITHER TRY TO FIND A DIFFERENT CONNECTION OR A DIFFERENT LOCATION OR TO USE L T E INSTEAD OF WIFI OR USE YOUR MOBILE DATA 
YOU1000000008_S0000035	OR YOU COULD STILL GO LIVE WITH THE CONNECTION THAT YOU HAVE BUT JUST BE AWARE THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME ISSUES 
YOU1000000008_S0000036	AND WHAT DO WE DO IN THAT CIRCUMSTANCES IF I'M GONNA GO LIVE AND I KNOW THAT THE INTERNET SPEED ISN'T ONE-HUNDRED PERCENT 
YOU1000000008_S0000037	THEN ONE OF THE VERY FIRST THINGS I WOULD DO WHEN I AM LIVE IS TO LET MY VIEWERS KNOW THAT WE MAYBE EXPERIENCING PROBLEM 
YOU1000000008_S0000038	BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT SURE HOW GOOD THE INTERNET IS IN THAT LOCATION SO AT LEAST THAT EXPECTATION HAS BEEN MET IN CASE THERE'S ANY ISSUES WITH YOUR STREAM 
YOU1000000008_S0000039	THEN OBVIOUSLY THEN IF YOU'RE RUNNING YOUR SPEED TEST AND YOU'VE GOT HIGHER THAN TWO POINT FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND UPLOAD THEN YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE ANY ISSUES AT ALL 
YOU1000000008_S0000040	STEP NUMBER FOUR IS TO GET EVERYTHING SET UP SO THIS MEANS SETTING UP YOUR CAMERA SETTING UP YOUR TRIPOD IF YOU'RE GONNA BE USING THE TRIPOD 
YOU1000000008_S0000041	MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS STABLE EVERYTHING IS AT THE CORRECT HEIGHT THAT YOU'VE GOT YOUR AUDIO AND YOUR LIGHT AND EVERYTHING SET UP READY TO GO FOR YOUR FACEBOOK LIVESTREAM 
YOU1000000008_S0000042	NOW OBVIOUSLY THIS IS GONNA DEPEND IF YOU'RE USING A CAMERA IF YOU'RE USING YOUR PHONE OR IF YOU'RE JUST USING YOUR LAPTOP AND A WEB CAM TO GO LIVE 
YOU1000000008_S0000043	AND THERE IS OBVIOUSLY DIFFERENT RECOMMENDED GEAR FOR THE DIFFERENT SCENARIOS 
YOU1000000008_S0000044	BUT I WILL LINK UP IN THE CARD NOW TO SOME OF THAT RECOMMENDED GEAR FOR GOING LIVE ON FACEBOOK LIVE FROM YOUR SMARTPHONE 
YOU1000000008_S0000045	SIMPLE THINGS LIKE HAVING A PORTABLE MICROPHONE AND A MINI TRI-POD SO THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PHONE OUT OF YOUR HANDS 
YOU1000000008_S0000046	AND INTO A STABLE POSITION AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT NO MATTER WHAT TYPE OF VIDEO OR LIVE YOU'RE CREATING GET YOUR PHONE OR YOUR CAMERA OUT OF YOUR HANDS AND GET IT SOMEWHERE STABLE 
YOU1000000008_S0000047	USE A TRIPOD IF YOU CAN OR JUST POSITION YOUR CAMERA SOMEWHERE WHERE IT'S NOT GONNA SHAKE AND MOVE AROUND A LOT FOR YOUR LIVES 
YOU1000000008_S0000048	NOW IF YOU'RE USING A MAC OR A P C TO GO LIVE YOU CAN USE SIMILAR GEAR AS WELL AND YOU CAN EITHER JUST USE YOUR FACEBOOK BROWSER TO GO LIVE 
YOU1000000008_S0000049	OR YOU CAN USE SOFTWARE LIKE E CAM OR EXPLOIT V MIX O B S WIRECAST THERE IS A HEAP OF OPTIONS OUT THERE FOR FACEBOOK LIVE 
YOU1000000008_S0000050	WE'RE SHOOTING ANOTHER VIDEO THAT WE'VE JUST RELEASED AND I'LL LINK THAT UP IN THE CARDS AS WELL COVERING OFF A HEAP OF DIFFERENT OPTIONS FOR GOING LIVE ON FACEBOOK 
YOU1000000008_S0000051	BUT NO MATTER WHICH WAY YOU'RE GOING LIVE THE IMPORTANT THING IS TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS SET-UP CORRECTLY AND HOW YOU WANT IT WITH AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE GEAR AS YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU GO LIVE 
YOU1000000008_S0000052	YOU DON'T WANNA BE TWEAKING AND CHANGING THINGS WHILE YOU'RE LIVE AND THAT LEADS US RIGHT INTO STEP NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS TO DO A TEST BROADCAST 
YOU1000000008_S0000053	SO THIS IS WHERE ONCE YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING SORTED PRESS THE LIVE BUTTON BUT MAKE SURE THAT THE LIVE BROADCAST IS ONLY GOING TO JUST YOU THAT IT'S A PRIVATE LIVE 
YOU1000000008_S0000054	SO IN THE FACEBOOK SETTINGS YOU GET TO CHOOSE WHO YOU WANNA BROADCAST TO AND THERE IS AN OPTION THERE TO BROADCAST TO ONLY ME OR JUST YOURSELF 
YOU1000000008_S0000055	SO THAT WAY THERE'S NO ONE ELSE THAT WILL SEE IT SO WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IN THIS TEST IS THAT EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD SOUNDS GOOD THAT EVERYTHING IS SET UP THE WAY THAT YOU'D LIKE IT 
YOU1000000008_S0000056	NOW IF YOU ARE GOING LIVE IN A SALES SCENARIO OR YOU'RE DOING THIS FOR A LIVE PROMOTION 
YOU1000000008_S0000057	NOW IT ALSO SUGGEST THAT WHILE YOU'RE RUNNING THIS LIVE THAT YOU DO A QUICK RUN THROUGH OF THE CONTENT YOU'RE GONNA BE PRESENTING AS WELL 
YOU1000000008_S0000058	SO THAT WAY YOU'LL FEEL MORE RELAXED CUZ YOU'VE HAD A RUN THROUGH BUT ALSO WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING BACK YOU CAN GIVE YOURSELF SOME FEEDBACK ON HOW YOU WENT IN YOUR LIVE TEST 
YOU1000000008_S0000059	STEP NUMBER SIX IS TO TELL PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO GO LIVE NOW THIS COULD BE AS SIMPLE AS SENDING OUT SOME TWEETS OR SOME INSTAGRAM POSTS OR FACEBOOK TO LET PEOPLE KNOW 
YOU1000000008_S0000060	BUT THERE IS ALSO A REALLY COOL WAY TO AUTOMATICALLY POST AND E-MAIL AS SOON AS YOU GO LIVE WITH A COOL APP CALLED LIVE LEAP SO I'M GONNA COVER THAT OFF IN A FEW MINUTES 
YOU1000000008_S0000061	BUT THERE ARE SOME WAYS TO AUTOMATE THAT PROCESS AS WELL AND STEP NUMBER SEVEN IS TO GO LIVE SO THE FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOU GO LIVE SHOULD BE TO DELIVER THE HOOK 
YOU1000000008_S0000062	START TALKING TO PEOPLE AS IF YOU'RE DELIVERING THE CONTENT AND THE VIDEO STRUCTURE THAT YOU HAD PLANNED OUT DON'T STOP TO WELCOME EVERYBODY IN AND START SOME IDLE CHIT-CHAT WITH PEOPLE 
YOU1000000008_S0000063	BECAUSE THAT WON'T FLY FOR THE PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING THE REPLAY THEY'RE GONNA LOOSE THAT CONNECTION WITH YOU SO FOCUS ON THE HOOK AND THEN GET STRAIGHT INTO THE CONTENT BEYOND THAT 
YOU1000000008_S0000064	WHILE YOU'RE LIVE YOU ALSO WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE MAKING EYE CONTACT DIRECTLY WITH YOUR VIEWERS WHICH MEANS LOOKING AT THE CAMERA LENS 
YOU1000000008_S0000065	NOT LOOKING OFF TO THE SIDE YOUR VIEWERS WOULD BE OUT OF NOTICE IF YOU'RE NOT LOOKING OR TALKING DIRECTLY TO THEM 
YOU1000000008_S0000066	SO YOU WANNA MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE LOOKING DIRECTLY DOWN YOUR CAMERA LENS SO YOU'RE MAKING THAT EYE CONTACT AND THAT DEEP CONNECTION WITH YOUR VIEWERS 
YOU1000000008_S0000067	NOW IT'S LIKELY THAT WHILE YOU'RE LIVE YOU ALSO WANNA INTERACT WITH YOUR AUDIENCE 
YOU1000000008_S0000068	BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT HERE TO TRY AND BATCH ALL YOUR LIVE INTERACTIONS INTO CERTAIN AREAS OF YOUR LIVESTREAM 
YOU1000000008_S0000069	YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANNA BREAK THE CONTENT THAT YOU'RE DELIVERING OR THE KEY TEACHINGS AND LEARNINGS FOR YOUR VIEWERS WITH YOU 
YOU1000000008_S0000070	DROPPING OFF AND SAYING HI TO SOMEONE AS THEY COME IN OR ANSWERING A COMMENT IMMEDIATELY SO FOR SOME LIVESTREAMS IT COULD BE THAT YOU BREAK EVERY FEW MINUTES THROUGHOUT 
YOU1000000008_S0000071	OR IN SOME CASES YOU MIGHT WANNA SAVE IT ALL UNTIL THE END OF YOUR VIDEO TO DO SOME INTERACTING OR SOME LIVE Q AND A 
YOU1000000008_S0000072	HOWEVER YOU DECIDE TO DO IT MAKE SURE YOU LET YOUR VIEWERS KNOW HOW IT'S GOING TO WORK AND WHEN YOU'RE GONNA BE ANSWERING THEIR QUESTIONS AND WHEN YOU'RE GONNA BE COVERING OFF THE CONTENT AS WELL 
YOU1000000008_S0000073	AND ALSO BE AWARE OF ANYTHING THAT CHANGES AUDIO WISE IN YOUR LIVESTREAM AS WELL 
YOU1000000008_S0000074	SO IF YOU ARE FILMING OUTSIDE AND A BIG TRUCK PULLED UP NEXT TO YOU THEN YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO PICK UP AND MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCATION WHILE YOU'RE STILL LIVE AND PRESENTING AND INTERACTING 
YOU1000000008_S0000075	SO THAT YOUR VIEWERS CAN ACTUALLY STILL HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING INSTEAD OF HAVING IT DROWNED OUT BY A TRUCK OR SOME OTHER NOISE 
YOU1000000008_S0000076	AND THE LAST THING TO REMEMBER WHILE YOU'RE LIVE IS TO HAVE FUN WITH YOUR LIVESTREAM 
YOU1000000008_S0000077	IF YOU'RE NOT HAVING FUN THEN IT'S GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOUR VIEWERS TO ENGAGE WITH YOU AND HAVE FUN AS WELL SO IT ALL COMES DOWN TO YOU HAVE FUN WITH YOUR LIVESTREAMS AND YOUR VIEWERS WILL ENJOY IT TOO 
YOU1000000008_S0000078	NOW I DID MENTION LIVE LEAP A FEW MINUTES AGO 
YOU1000000008_S0000079	SO WHAT LIVE LEAP IS IS IT'S THIS AMAZING TOOL THAT LET'S YOU AUTOMATICALLY SHARE OUT YOUR FACEBOOK LIVES THE INSTANT THAT YOU GO LIVE ON FACEBOOK LIVE

YOU1000000012_S0000012	SO THAT YOU DON'T MISS OUT SO STRAIGHT OFF THE BAT THE FIRST ONE THAT WE NEED TO MENTION IS THE FACEBOOK WEBSITE 
YOU1000000012_S0000013	THE EASIEST WAY TO GO LIVE IN A LOT OF CASES IS JUST TO USE THE FACEBOOK WEBSITE WITH YOUR WEBCAM CHOOSE TO CREATE A NEW POST AND CLICK LIVE 
YOU1000000012_S0000014	AND THEN YOU'RE BROADCASTING LIVE DIRECTLY FROM YOUR LAPTOP OR COMPUTER WITH JUST YOUR WEBCAM SO IT'S PROBABLY THE EASIEST WAY TO GO LIVE 
YOU1000000012_S0000015	FROM YOUR DESKTOP WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ANY OTHER SOFTWARE OR PLATFORM SO THE BIGGEST ADVANTAGE WITH THIS IS THAT YOU DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE YOU'RE NOT PAYING FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTIONS 
YOU1000000012_S0000016	YOU'VE LITERALLY GOT GOT ALL THAT YOU NEED IN THE FACEBOOK WEBSITE AND WITH A RECENT UPDATE YOU CAN NOW SHARE YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN ON YOUR FACEBOOK LIVES JUST USING THE FACEBOOK WEBSITE AS WELL 
YOU1000000012_S0000017	SO THE BIGGEST DISADVANTAGE IS THEN THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY ADVANCED CONTROLS SO YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO BRING ANYONE ELSE IN OR TO REALLY DO ANYTHING FANCY WITH YOUR LIVE STREAMING ON FACEBOOK 
YOU1000000012_S0000018	OPTION NUMBER TWO IS TO USE LIVE BROADCASTING OR LIVE STREAMING SOFTWARE LIKE O B S OR OPEN BROADCASTER SOFTWARE AND WIRECAST STUDIO 
YOU1000000012_S0000019	NOW BOTH OF THESE ARE FAIRLY COMPLEXED SOLUTIONS THESE WILL GIVE YOU A PROFESSIONAL RANGE OF TOOLS FOR CREATING PROFESSIONAL-LOOKING LIVE STREAMS 
YOU1000000012_S0000020	THINGS LIKE BEING ABLE TO BRING IN MULTIPLE CAMERA ANGLES AND SEAMLESSLY SWITCH BETWEEN THEM TO HAVE MULTIPLE SCREEN SHARES 
YOU1000000012_S0000021	TO REALLY HAVE A FULL RANGE OF CONTROL AND CUSTOMIZABILITY OVER YOUR LIVE STREAMS WE HAVE DONE A FULL COMPARISON OF O B S AND COMPARING IT TO WIRECAST 
YOU1000000012_S0000022	AND I WILL LINK THAT UP IN THE CARDS NOW IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THAT BUT ONE OF THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE PRICE O B S WHICH RUNS ON MAC PC AND LINUX IS FREE ONE HUNDRED PERCENT FREE 
YOU1000000012_S0000023	WIRECAST STUDIO ON THE OTHER HAND WHICH RUNS ON BOTH MAC AND PC CURRENTLY SELLS FOR SIX-HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVE DOLLARS WHICH JUST ACTUALLY HAD A DECENT PRICE INCREASE FROM FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY FIVE DOLLARS 
YOU1000000012_S0000024	THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE THOUGH BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE LEVEL OF CONTROL AND CUSTOMIZABILITY AND ALSO THE EASE OF USE 
YOU1000000012_S0000025	WIRECAST AT THAT PRICE POINT IS MUCH MUCH EASIER TO SET UP AND USE AND IT'S ACTUALLY ONE OF MY GO-TO SOLUTIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL LIVE STREAMS 
YOU1000000012_S0000026	IT'S WHAT WE USE FOR ALL OUR CLIENT PROJECTS IN THE LATEST UPDATE THOUGH FROM WIRECAST WHERE THEY GOT THEIR PRICE INCREASE AS WELL 
YOU1000000012_S0000027	THEY'VE ACTUALLY ANNOUNCED A REALLY DECENT FEATURE A REALLY COOL FEATURE WHICH LETS YOU BRING IN GUESTS TO INTERVIEW THEM LIVE SEAMLESSLY USING THE WIRECAST SOFTWARE 
YOU1000000012_S0000028	SO IT WOULD BE SIMILAR TO BRINGING SOMEONE IN ON A SKYPE CALL SO THAT YOU CAN BRING SOMEONE IN AND INTERVIEW THEM AND GO LIVE THROUGH WIRECAST AS WELL 
YOU1000000012_S0000029	NOW YOU CAN DO A SIMILAR SORT OF THING WITH O B S AND BRING IN GUESTS USING APPLICATIONS LIKE SKYPE AND SCREEN SHARING THAT SKYPE CALL BUT IT CAN GET PRETTY COMPLICATED AND PRETTY MESSY 
YOU1000000012_S0000030	ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SORT OUT YOUR AUDIO ISSUES AND REMOVING ECHO AND YEAH IT'S POSSIBLE BUT IT'S DEFINITELY COMPLICATED AND THAT'S PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING WITH THESE TWO 
YOU1000000012_S0000031	THEY'RE NOT FOR THE FAINTHEARTED YOU DEFINITELY NEED TO INVEST SOME TIME INTO O B S OR WIRECAST TO GET UP TO SPREAD BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT SO MUCH CONTROL OVER YOUR LIVE STREAMS IN THERE 
YOU1000000012_S0000032	BUT BOTH OF THESE WILL NOT ONLY LET YOU BROADCAST TO FACEBOOK LIVE THEY'LL BOTH LET YOU ALSO BROADCAST TO OTHER LIVE STREAMING PLATFORMS LIKE YOUTUBE LIVE TWITCH PERISCOPE AND A HEAP OF OTHERS OUT THERE AS WELL 
YOU1000000012_S0000033	SO BOTH GREAT SOLUTIONS IF YOU WANT A REALLY PROFESSIONAL-LOOKING LIVE STREAM WITH MULTIPLE CAMERAS AND YEAH COMPLICATED SETUPS

YOU1000000012_S0000042	SO IT IS AMAZING THAT YOU GET THIS IN A DESKTOP APP AGAIN IT'S CURRENTLY MAC ONLY HOPEFULLY SOMEWHERE IN THE FUTURE THEY'LL ALSO RELEASE A PC VERSION

YOU1000000012_S0000072	THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE BRINGING INTO YOUR CALL WEATHER IT'S JUST YOU AND YOU'VE GOT OTHER PEOPLE AS GUESTS OR WHETHER YOU WANT TO BRING OTHER PEOPLE IN AS PANELISTS OR CO-HOSTS 
YOU1000000012_S0000073	WHETHER THEIR WEBCAMS ARE ON BY DEFAULT OR MUTED WHERE YOU CAN CONTROL ALL OF THAT WHILE YOU'RE LIVE AS WELL IT'S ALSO GOT BUILD-IN POLLING IT'S GOT A BUILT-IN CHAT WINDOW 
YOU1000000012_S0000074	SO YOU CAN INTERACT WITH YOUR AUDIENCE WHILE YOU'RE LIVE FROM INSIDE THE ZOOM CALL AS WELL 
YOU1000000012_S0000075	ONE OF THE BIG ADVANTAGES WITH ZOOM IS HOW EASY IT IS TO CREATE THE LIVE CALL OR THE LIVE LINK AND GET THAT SENT OUT TO YOUR PARTICIPANTS OR GUESTS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON THE CALL 
YOU1000000012_S0000076	SO YOU HAVE THE THE CALL AUTOMATICALLY SCHEDULED AND ENTERED INTO YOUR CALENDAR SO THERE'S A HEAP OF REALLY PROFESSIONAL FUNCTIONALITY AND REMINDERS THAT ARE BUILT IN 
YOU1000000012_S0000077	ALL AROUND SCHEDULING THE CALL AND MAKING SURE THAT YOUR GUESTS ARE THERE AND IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND ALSO HELPING THEM TEST THEIR AUDIO AND THEIR WEBCAM AS THEY JOIN THE CALL 
YOU1000000012_S0000078	TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING IS WORKING ONE OF THE OTHER REALLY POWERFUL FEATURES OF ZOOM IS NOT ONLY DOES IT LET YOU RECORD YOUR 
YOU1000000012_S0000079	CALL OR YOUR LIVE DIRECTLY TO YOUR LOCAL COMPUTER BUT IT ALSO GIVES YOU THE ABILITY TO RECORD YOUR CALLS AND SAVE THEM IN THE CLOUD AS WELL 
YOU1000000012_S0000080	AND WHEN YOU ENABLE THE CLOUD RECORDING IT ACTUALLY RECORDS TWO FILES FOR YOU IT RECORDS THE SPEAKER VIEW WHICH IS THE DEFAULT VIEW 
YOU1000000012_S0000081	WHICH CHANGES BASED ON WHOEVER IS TALKING SO IT'S THE FULL-SCREEN VERSION OF WHOEVER IS SPEAKING AND SWITCHES AUTOMATICALLY BUT IT ALSO GIVES YOU THE GALLERY VIEW AS WELL 
YOU1000000012_S0000082	SO IF YOU'VE GOT A FEW PEOPLE ON THERE THEN IT WOULD SHOW EVERYONE ON THE SCREEN FOR THAT RECORDING SO TO HAVE THAT ABILITY YOU'RE ABLE TO RECORD IN TWO SEPARATE FILES 
YOU1000000012_S0000083	THE TWO DIFFERENT CAMERA VIEWS IS AMAZING SO IN REGARDS TO PRICING IN ORDER TO USE ZOOM FOR LIVE STREAMING YOU NEED TO BE ON THEIR PRO PLAN WHICH COSTS FOURTEEN NINETY-NINE PER MONTH 
YOU1000000012_S0000084	BUT YOU'RE ALSO GONNA NEED TO ADD THE WEBINAR ADD-ON TO ACTUALLY GO LIVE WHICH COST AN ADDITIONAL FORTY DOLLARS PER MONTH 
YOU1000000012_S0000085	SO IN ORDER TO GO LIVE ON FACEBOOK WITH ZOOM YOU WILL BE SPENDING FIFTY-FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH 
YOU1000000012_S0000086	SO NOW ON TO NUMBER SIX WHICH IS CROWDCAST NOW CROWDCAST AND ZOOM ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR IN REGARDS TO PRODUCT OFFERING BOTH OF THEM WILL LET YOU HAVE LIVE POLLING 
YOU1000000012_S0000087	SO YOU CAN ASK QUESTIONS TO YOUR PEOPLE WATCHING AND SEE THE RESULTS IN REAL TIME THEY'LL BOTH HAVE CHAT THEY'LL BOTH HANDLE QUESTIONS BUT CROWDCAST IS PROBABLY A MORE POLISH SOLUTION AT LEAST FOR WEBINARS ANYWAY 
YOU1000000012_S0000088	WHAT YOU GET IN CROWDCAST THOUGH AFTER YOUR LIVE STREAM IS SOME REALLY ADVANCED DETAIL AND ANALYTICS ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE 
YOU1000000012_S0000089	HOW LONG THEY STAYED FOR WHERE THEY CAME IN FROM SO THE LEVEL OF ANALYTICS AND DATA THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO CAPTURE IN CROWDCAST IS PRETTY AMAZING 
YOU1000000012_S0000090	CROWDCAST ALSO HAS INTEGRATION WITH ZAPIER AND WITH DRIP MEANING YOU CAN GET SOME GREAT DATA AND ANALYTICS THROUGH FROM YOUR LIVE CALLS INTO YOUR C R M WHICH IS A REALLY COOL FEATURE 
YOU1000000012_S0000091	CROWDCAST ALSO HAS A MULTI-STREAM FEATURE WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO BE A BROADCAST YOUR CROWDCAST CALL OR MEETING ONTO FACEBOOK LIVE 
YOU1000000012_S0000092	BUT THIS MULTI-STREAM FEATURE ALSO LET YOU BROADCAST TO MULTIPLE LIVE PLATFORMS AS WELL SO WHETHER THAT'S MULTIPLE FACEBOOK LIVE PAGES ACCOUNTS GROUPS EVENTS OR YOU COULD BROADCAST LIVE TO FACEBOOK AND YOUTUBE AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU1000000012_S0000093	IN REGARDS TO PRICING CROWDCAST HAS THREE PRICING OPTIONS 
YOU1000000012_S0000094	THE FIRST IS THEIR LIVE PACKAGE AT FORTY-NINE DOLLARS PER MONTH THEN THEY'VE GOT A PROFESSIONAL PACKAGE AT EIGHTY-NINE DOLLARS PER MONTH AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE ONE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO NEED 
YOU1000000012_S0000095	IF YOU WANNA BE DOING LIVES TO FACEBOOK LIVE OR YOUTUBE LIVE AND THERE'S ALSO A BUSINESS PLANS AS WELL FOR ONE-HUNDRED AND NINETY-FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH 
YOU1000000012_S0000096	SO IT'S DEFINITELY NOT ON THE CHEAPER END OF THINGS SO THE MAIN DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU'RE COMPARING THE PROFESSIONAL PACKAGE TO THE BUSINESS PACKAGE IS THE NUMBER OF LIVE ATTENDEES 
YOU1000000012_S0000097	IT GOES FROM TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY UP TO FIVE HUNDRED AND THE COST FOR AN EXTRA LIVE ATTENDEE GOES FROM THIRTY CENTS DOWN TO FIFTEEN CENTS ON THE BUSINESS PLAN 
YOU1000000012_S0000098	BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT THESE NUMBERS FOR ATTENDEES AREN'T IN RELATION TO FACEBOOK LIVE THIS IS ONLY FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE ATTENDING YOUR CALL OR YOUR WEBINAR ON THE ACTUAL PLATFORM 
YOU1000000012_S0000099	IF YOU'RE GONNA USING THIS FOR FACEBOOK LIVE WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN THIS VIDEO THEN THERE MAY NOT BE ANYONE THAT'S ACTUALLY ATTENDING ON THE ACTUAL PLATFORM 
YOU1000000012_S0000100	THEY'LL BE WATCHING AND INTERACTING WITH YOU THROUGH FACEBOOK LIVE SO IF ALL YOU'RE INTERESTED IN IS USING CROWDCAST FOR FACEBOOK LIVES THEN YOU'LL DEFINITELY BE ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH THE PROFESSIONAL PLAN

YOU1000000016_S0000001	WHETHER IT'S TO YOUTUBE LIVE FACEBOOK LIVE TWITCH ALMOST ANY OTHER PLATFORM WE'VE GOT YOU COVERED IN THIS VIDEO 
YOU1000000016_S0000003	HEY IT'S JUSTIN BROWN HERE FROM PRIMAL VIDEO WHERE WE HELP YOU AMPLIFY YOUR BUSINESS AND BRAND WITH VIDEO 
YOU1000000016_S0000004	IF YOU'RE NEW HERE MAKE SURE TO CLICK THAT SUBSCRIBE BUTTON AND ALL THE LINKS TO EVERYTHING WE MENTION IN THIS VIDEO YOU CAN FIND LINKED IN THE DESCRIPTION BOX MUCH BELOW 
YOU1000000016_S0000005	SO LET'S JUST JUMP INTO IT NOW WITH SOME SIMPLE TOOLS THESE DAYS IT'S REALLY EASY TO LIVESTREAM TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS IN FACT THERE'S EVEN A NAME FOR IT AND IT'S CALLED SIMULCASTING 
YOU1000000016_S0000006	SO THAT MEANS YOU CAN EASILY CREATE ONE LIVESTREAM AND PUSH IT OUT TO MULTIPLE LIVE PLATFORMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000007	OR STREAMING SOURCES LIKE FACEBOOK LIVE YOUTUBE LIVE TWITCH AND A TON OF OTHER PLATFORMS AS WELL 
YOU1000000016_S0000008	NOW WE ACTUALLY DID A VIDEO THIS TOPIC A LITTLE WHILE BACK BUT SINCE THEN SO MUCH HAS CHANGED AND IT HAS NOW BECOME SO MUCH EASIER TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS 
YOU1000000016_S0000009	SO I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME TO UPDATE THAT VIDEO AND RUN THROUGH THE NEW BEST WAYS TO DO THIS OR THE NEW OPTIONS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS 
YOU1000000016_S0000010	AND WHILE WE'RE GOING THROUGH IT I WANNA HEAR FROM YOU GUYS WHAT SOCIAL OR CONTENT PLATFORMS ARE YOU MOST ACTIVE ON WHEN IT COMES TO LIVE STREAMING 
YOU1000000016_S0000011	WE'RE GONNA START TO PICK UP OUR GAME A LITTLE BIT ON THE YOUTUBE LIVE SIDE OF THINGS BUT WE MAY LOOK AT OTHER PLATFORMS TOO THANKS TO SIMULCASTING 
YOU1000000016_S0000012	NOW YOU'VE REALLY GOT TWO MAIN OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO LIVESTREAMING TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000013	THE FIRST ONE IS TO PUSH OUT MULTIPLE STREAMS FROM YOUR BROADCASTING SOFTWARE NOW THIS IS REALLY ONLY POSSIBLE IN SOFTWARE LIKE VMIX OR AH LIKE WIRECAST 
YOU1000000016_S0000014	WHERE YOU'RE ABLE TO SET UP MULTIPLE OUTPUT SOURCES SO INSTEAD OF JUST SENDING YOUR LIVESTREAM FEED TO YOUTUBE YOU'RE ALSO ABLE TO ADD IN AN ADDITIONAL STREAM 
YOU1000000016_S0000015	FOR FACEBOOK OR FOR TWITCH OR WHEREVER ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO BROADCAST TO 
YOU1000000016_S0000016	SO THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH WHAT WE HAVE COVERED THE FIRST TIME WE TACKLED THIS AND I'LL PUT A LINK UP TO THAT VIDEO BECAUSE THAT METHOD STILL DOES WORK 
YOU1000000016_S0000017	BUT THE BIGGEST DOWNSIDE WITH THAT IS THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY PUSHING THOSE MULTIPLE STREAMS FROM YOUR ONE COMPUTER AND FROM YOUR ONE INTERNET CONNECTION 
YOU1000000016_S0000018	WHICH MEANS IT CAN PUT YOUR COMPUTER UNDER LOAD BUT IT ALSO CAN PUT YOUR INTERNET BANDWIDTH UNDER LOAD 
YOU1000000016_S0000019	SO IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE PUSHING MULTIPLE STREAMS YOU WILL NEED AT LEAST TWICE THE AVAILABLE BANDWIDTH 
YOU1000000016_S0000020	OR IF YOU'RE RUNNING THREE STREAM YOU'LL NEED THREE TIMES THE BANDWIDTH THAT YOU WOULD FOR ONE STREAM ACROSS EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL STREAMS TO BE I DON'T PUSHED THEM ALL OUT 
YOU1000000016_S0000021	THE OTHER BIG DOWNSIDE OF MULTICASTING THAT WAY WAS THE INTERACTIONS OR THE COMMENTS THEY WERE ALL SEPARATE THERE WAS NO WAY TO PULL THEM ALL TOGETHER 
YOU1000000016_S0000022	SO YOU CAN BRING IN COMMENTS FROM YOUTUBE TWITCH AND FACEBOOK ALL INTO ONE CHAT WINDOW FOR YOU RUNNING THE STREAM TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR THEM IN ONE PLACE 
YOU1000000016_S0000023	YOU LITERALLY HAD TO GO TO FACEBOOK AND THEN OVER TO TWITCH AND THEN OVER TO YOUTUBE TO BE ABLE TO SEE EACH ONE OF THOSE DIFFERENT COMMENT FEEDS 
YOU1000000016_S0000024	SO WHILE ALL THAT WAS DOABLE IT WAS A PAIN TO SET UP AND IT COULD BE RATHER FRUSTRATING TO MANAGE AND SEE EVERYTHING WHILE YOU'RE ACTUALLY LIVE 
YOU1000000016_S0000025	BUT THE OPTION THAT I'M ABOUT TO SHOW YOU NOW OPTION NUMBER TWO WILL REQUIRE NO ADDITIONAL BANDWIDTH WILL PUT YOUR COMPUTER UNDER NO ADDITIONAL LOAD AND YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE A LARGER ARRANGE OF LIVESTREAMING SOFTWARE 
YOU1000000016_S0000026	OR PLATFORMS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS 
YOU1000000016_S0000027	SO WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT HERE IS A MULTICAST OR A SIMULCAST PLATFORM THAT YOU SEND YOUR LIVESTREAM TO THEM AND THEY PUSH IT OUT TO THE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS FOR YOU 
YOU1000000016_S0000028	NOW THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PLATFORMS OUT THERE THAT OFFER THIS SERVICE OF RE-BROADCASTING AND RE-DISTRIBUTING YOUR CONTENT OUT FOR YOU 
YOU1000000016_S0000029	AND IN THERE YOU'VE GOT A MASSIVE RANGE FROM SUPER BASIC RIGHT UP TO ENTERPRISE GRADE AND OBVIOUSLY THE ENTERPRISE GRADE ONES ARE GONNA COME WITH THE ENTERPRISE PRICE TAG 
YOU1000000016_S0000030	SO THERE'S REALLY THREE MAIN OPTIONS WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE OF US THAT ARE LOOKING JUST TO PUSH OUR LIVESTREAMS OUT TO MULTIPLE PLACES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR ENTERPRISE STUFF 
YOU1000000016_S0000031	AND THE THREE MOST POPULAR AND MY TOP THREE ARE RE-STREAM SWITCHBOARD AND CASTR 
YOU1000000016_S0000032	NOW ALL THREE OF THESE MAKE IT REALLY SIMPLE TO PUSH YOUR LIVESTREAM OUT TO MULTIPLE SOURCES AT THE SAME TIME 
YOU1000000016_S0000033	SO THEY ALL SUPPORT THINGS LIKE YOUTUBE LIVE FACEBOOK LIVE TWITCH ALL THE POPULAR ONES AND THEY ALSO HAVE R T M P SO YOU CAN REALLY PUSH YOUR LIVESTREAM OUT TO ANYWHERE 
YOU1000000016_S0000034	USING THAT R T M P PROTOCOL 
YOU1000000016_S0000035	THEY ALSO ALL HAVE INTEGRATED COMMENTS OR INTEGRATED CHAT MEANING THAT NO MATTER WHICH SERVICES YOU'RE BROADCASTING TO YOU CAN PULL IN THE CHAT TO ONE CENTRAL LOCATION 
YOU1000000016_S0000036	MAKING IT EASY FOR YOU TO EITHER BRING THOSE COMMENTS AND THOSE CHAT ELEMENTS UP ONSCREEN IN YOUR LIVESTREAM OR JUST TO MAKE IT EASY FOR YOU TO MONITOR 
YOU1000000016_S0000037	AND INTERACT WITH PEOPLE WHILE YOU'RE LIVE AND ALL THREE OF THOSE ALSO HAVE GLOBAL SERVERS WHERE YOU CAN MANUALLY PICK THE FASTEST SERVERS OR THE SERVERS CLOSEST TO YOU 
YOU1000000016_S0000038	TO RE-BROADCAST OUT YOUR LIVESTREAM WITH THE LOWEST LATENCY MEANING THAT IT'S NOT GONNA ADD A DELAY OR A BIG DELAY TO YOUR LIVESTREAM FOR THOSE WATCHING ON THE DIFFERENT PLATFORMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000039	IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE ALMOST INSTANT IF YOU'RE PICKING A SERVER THAT IS CLOSE TO YOUR LOCATION 
YOU1000000016_S0000040	NOW IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FACEBOOK LIVE IS ACTUALLY TREATED A LITTLE DIFFERENT IT'S TREATED SEPARATELY FROM PRETTY MUCH ALL THE OTHER BROADCAST PLATFORMS OUT THEN YOU'LL SEE THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE PRICING OPTIONS 
YOU1000000016_S0000041	OF THESES SERVICES AND HOW THEY TREAT FACEBOOK BUT IT'S ALL TO DO WITH THE WAY THAT FACEBOOK ACTUALLY LETS YOU BROADCAST LIVE TO THEM 
YOU1000000016_S0000042	AND IN SOME OF THESE CASES YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY A LITTLE BIT EXTRA OR A LOT MORE TO BE ABLE TO BROADCAST TO FACEBOOK OR TO MULTIPLE FACEBOOK LOCATIONS 
YOU1000000016_S0000043	NOW I'M GONNA QUICKLY RUN THROUGH SOME OF THE STANDOUT PROS AND CONS FOR EACH OF THESE THREE FOR SWITCHBOARD FOR RE-STREAM AND FOR CASTR TO HELP YOU BETTER DECIDE WHICH ONE IS GOING TO BE THE PICK FOR YOU 
YOU1000000016_S0000044	BUT THIS REALLY ISN'T A FULL COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW OF FEATURE COMPARISON OF THE THREE THIS IS JUST THE STANDOUT PROS AND CONS AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED 
YOU1000000016_S0000045	TO REALLY HELP YOU NARROW DOWN WHICH ONE OF THESE IS GOING TO BE THE BEST FIT FOR YOU 
YOU1000000016_S0000046	ALRIGHT SO RESTREAM OR RESTREAM DOT I O IS PROBABLY THE MOST POPULAR AND MOST PEOPLE'S GO TO PLATFORM FOR MULTICASTING OR GETTING THEIR LIVESTREAM OUT TO MULTIPLE PLACES 
YOU1000000016_S0000047	IT IS BY FAR THE MOST FEATURE RICH BUT ITS ALSO PROBABLY THE MOST UNINTUITIVE OR THE HARDEST TO USE 
YOU1000000016_S0000048	IT'S GOT THE MOST ADVANCED CONTROL IN REGARDS TO THE CHAT OR THE COMMENT FEEDS 
YOU1000000016_S0000049	AND IT'S ALSO GOT A P I INTEGRATION SO THAT'S IT'S REALLY EASY TO INTEGRATE THAT CHAT ROLL INTO YOUR LIVE STREAMING SOFTWARE LIKE WIRECAST AND O B S 
YOU1000000016_S0000050	IT ALSO HAS BUILT IN LIVE TRANSCODING WHICH MEANS THAT YOU CAN TRANSCODE OR CONVERT YOUR LIVESTREAM INTO DIFFERENT FORMATS DIFFERENT QUALITIES DIFFERENT SIZES 
YOU1000000016_S0000051	WHILE YOU'RE LIVE TO MATCH DIFFERENT PLATFORMS THAT YOU MIGHT BE BROADCASTING LIVE TO 
YOU1000000016_S0000052	AND ANOTHER GREAT FEATURE IS THAT RESTREAM DON'T LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF BANDWIDTH OR THE BITRATE OF THE QUALITY OF YOUR LIVESTREAMS GOING IN OR OUT OF THEIR SERVICE 
YOU1000000016_S0000053	THEY ALSO MAKE IT REALLY EASY TO RESIZE THOSE DIFFERENT VERSIONS SO IF YOU'RE BROADCASTING A WIDE SCREEN VIDEO AND YOU WANNA CONVERT IT IN RESTREAM 
YOU1000000016_S0000054	SO THAT YOUR FACEBOOK VERSION IS GOING OUT IN PORTRAIT THEY MAKE THAT REALLY EASY AS WELL 
YOU1000000016_S0000055	NOW THERE'S REALLY TWO MAIN DOWNSIDES TO RESTREAM THE FIRST ONE I TOUCHED ON ALREADY IT'S AROUND HAVING ALL OF THESE EXTRA FEATURES BUT THE ACTUAL INTERFACE ISN'T SUPER INTUITIVE 
YOU1000000016_S0000056	OR IT'S NOT EASY TO FIND EVERYTHING AND IT CAN GET OVERWHELMING AND COMPLICATED TO GO THROUGH AND JUST CREATE SOME SIMPLE RESTREAMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000057	SO IT'S REALLY FOR PROBABLY THE MORE ADVANCED SIDE OF THINGS 
YOU1000000016_S0000058	THE SECOND ONE IS THAT THEY ADD THEIR BRANDING TO YOUR LIVESTREAMS UP UNTIL YOU REACH THEIR PRO PLAN 
YOU1000000016_S0000059	SO ON THEIR PRO PLAN THEY'LL LET YOU REMOVE THEIR BRANDING 
YOU1000000016_S0000060	THERE'S NOT JUST THE BRANDING INSIDE OF YOUR LIVESTREAMS LIKE A WATERMARK ON IT 
YOU1000000016_S0000061	IT'S ACTUALLY INTO YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA STREAMS AS WELL SO IN RESTREAM YOU CAN SET IT UP SO THAT WHEN YOU'RE LIVE IT'LL TWEET OUT AND AND MAYBE DO A FACEBOOK POST OUT 
YOU1000000016_S0000062	BUT IN THERE IT'S ACTUALLY IT'S GOT THEIR BRANDING IN IT IT IT'S GOT MENTIONS OF THEM AND TAGS THEM IN YOUR POSTS SO I THINK FOR ANYONE THAT'S USING THIS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE 
YOU1000000016_S0000063	UM YOU DEFINITELY DON'T WANNA HAVE THAT GOING ON WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO START AT THE PRO PLAN 
YOU1000000016_S0000064	SO IT'S NOT A DEAL BREAKER BUT IT JUST MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOTTA BE USING THEE PRO PLAN TO GET RID OF ALL OF THAT BRANDING 
YOU1000000016_S0000065	NOW WHEN IT COMES TO PRICING THEY'VE SPLIT THIS OFF INTO TWO SO YOU'VE GOT INDIVIDUAL PRICING PLANS AND YOU'VE GOT COMPANY PRICING PLANS 
YOU1000000016_S0000066	IF IT WAS A FREE PLAN THAT LET YOU BROADCAST OUT YOUR STREAM TO THIRTY PLUS STREAMING PLATFORMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000067	BUT THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE FACEBOOK THERE'S ALSO A STANDARD PLAN AT SIXTEEN DOLLARS PER MONTH AND THAT GIVES YOU ACCESS TO LIVESTREAM TO ONE FACEBOOK CHANNEL 
YOU1000000016_S0000068	AND ALSO GIVES YOU THE ABILITY IN REAL TIME TO SWITCH OR TOGGLE BETWEEN OR ON OR OFF THE DIFFERENT LIVE STREAMING PLATFORMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000069	AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE PROFESSIONAL PLAN WHICH IS FORTY-ONE DOLLARS PER MONTH THIS WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS TO THREE FACEBOOK CHANNELS AND ALSO IT TAKES THE BRANDING OFF AS WELL 
YOU1000000016_S0000070	NOW THE TRANSCODING THAT I MENTIONED JUST BEFORE IS AN ADDITIONAL TWO DOLLARS PER HOUR FOR THE LENGTH OF YOUR LIVESTREAM 
YOU1000000016_S0000071	NOW UP FROM THAT THEY DO HAVE PREMIUM BUSINESS AND ENTERPRISE PLANS AVAILABLE AS WELL 
YOU1000000016_S0000072	AND THIS GIVES YOU ACCESS TO FIVE FACEBOOK CHANNELS ON THE PREMIUM AND FIFTEEN FACEBOOK CHANNELS ON THE BUSINESS NOW WE SEE THE ENTERPRISE ONE IS FOR THOSE THAT ARE REALLY CRAZY SERIOUS ABOVE AND BEYOND THAT POINT 
YOU1000000016_S0000073	THE NEXT OPTION YOU'VE GOT IS SWITCHBOARD OR SWITCHBOARD DOT LIVE NOW THIS IS ANOTHER REALLY AWESOME PLATFORM TO BE ABLE TO MULTICAST YOUR LIVESTREAMS OUT 
YOU1000000016_S0000074	THEY'VE GOT A REALLY INTUITIVE REALLY EASY TO USE INTERFACE IT'S SO EASY TO QUICKLY JUMP IN 
YOU1000000016_S0000075	LINK UP YOUR CHANNELS YOUR FACEBOOK PAGES AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND START TO BROADCAST OUT FROM THERE 
YOU1000000016_S0000076	ONCE AGAIN THEY'VE GOT REALLY GREAT CHAT INTEGRATION NOT QUITE TO THE LEVEL THAT YOU GET IN RESTREAM BUT STILL REALLY SOLID AND STILL THEY MAKE IT PRETTY EASY TO GET IT INTO YOUR LIVE STREAMING PROGRAMS AS WELL 
YOU1000000016_S0000077	AND YOU'VE ALSO GOT TRANSCODING CAPABILITIES AGAIN TO PUSH THE DIFFERENT VERSIONS FOR DIFFERENT PLATFORMS BUT ONE OF THE COOL FEATURES THAT YOU'VE GOT INSIDE OF SWITCHBOARD IS 
YOU1000000016_S0000078	THAT FOR EACH ONE OF THE BROADCASTS THAT YOU HAVE OR EACH ONE OF THE PLATFORMS THAT YOU'RE BROADCASTING TO YOU CAN TOTALLY CUSTOMIZE THEM UP 
YOU1000000016_S0000079	TO HAVE EVEN INDIVIDUAL BRANDING SO YOUR FACEBOOK LIVESTREAM COULD HAVE DIFFERENT BRANDING TO YOUR YOUTUBE LIVESTREAM WHICH HAS TOTALLY DIFFERENT BRANDING TO YOUR TWITCH LIVESTREAMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000080	SO EVEN WHILE THE CONTENT THAT YOU'RE BROADCASTING OUT FROM YOUR COMPUTER IS THE SAME YOU'VE GOT A DIFFERENT VERSION OR DIFFERENT LOGOS AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS ON EACH OF THEM 
YOU1000000016_S0000081	ALL MANAGED THROUGH SWITCHBOARD EVEN LITTLE THINGS LIKE BEING ABLE TO BULK START AND STOP STREAMS AND MULTIPLE STREAMS IS JUST SO EASY TO DO INSIDE OF SWITCHBOARD SO THEY MAKE A LOT OF THIS STUFF REALLY REALLY EASY 
YOU1000000016_S0000082	IT'S NOW WHEN REGARDS TO THE DOWNSIDES OF SWITCHBOARD I THINK MOST OF THESE ARE REALLY BASED AROUND THEIR PRICING MODELS 
YOU1000000016_S0000083	AND THE RESTRICTIONS THAT COME IN AT THE DIFFERENT PRICING MODELS SO FIRST OFF THERE'S NO FREE OPTION BUT THERE IS A NINETY-NINE DOLLAR PER MONTH PROFESSIONAL PLAN 
YOU1000000016_S0000084	AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THEIR LOWEST ENTRY LEVEL PLAN NOW THEY DO HAVE A FOURTEEN DAY TRIAL AVAILABLE 
YOU1000000016_S0000085	BUT ON THAT PLAN YOUR LIVESTREAMS ARE GOING TO BE RESTRICTED TO FIVE MEGABITS PER SECOND AND AT A MAXIMUM RESOLUTION OF TEN-EIGHTY P 
YOU1000000016_S0000086	BUT THEY'LL LET YOU BROADCAST OUT SIMULTANEOUSLY TO FIVE PROVIDERS AND TWO OF THOSE INCLUDE FACEBOOK 
YOU1000000016_S0000087	NOW THEY ALSO HAVE RESTRICTIONS AROUND THE DURATION OF YOUR LIVESTREAMS AND YOUR MULTICAST AS WELL 
YOU1000000016_S0000088	ON THEIR PROFESSIONAL PLAN YOU ARE LIMITED TO FIFTY HOURS PER MONTH 
YOU1000000016_S0000089	AND TWELVE HOURS PER LIVESTREAM NOW DEPENDING ON THE TYPE AND THE AMOUNT OF LIVESTREAMING THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DOING NONE OF THOSE MAY COME INTO EFFECT 
YOU1000000016_S0000090	MAY AFFECT YOU TOO MUCH BUT THEY DO HAVE TWO OTHER PLANS LISTED ON THEIR WEBSITE FOR BUSINESS AND FOR ENTERPRISE BUT NEITHER ONE OF THEM HAS PRICING AVAILABLE 
YOU1000000016_S0000091	SO YOU NEED TO REACH OUT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN PRICING FOR THOSE BUT OBVIOUSLY WITH THOSE A LOT OF THOSE RESTRICTIONS 
YOU1000000016_S0000092	HAVE BEEN MOVED OR RAISED 
YOU1000000016_S0000093	SO NOW FOR THE THIRD OPTION WHICH WAS CASTR OR CASTR DOT I O NOW THIS IS PROBABLY THE NEW KID ON THE BLOCK 
YOU1000000016_S0000094	AND IT'S ACTUALLY PROBABLY THE MOST COMPELLING OFFER AS WELL AND THE ONE THAT I'M THE MOST EXCITED ABOUT THERE YOU GO JUST SPOILT THE REST OF THE VIDEO FOR YOU 
YOU1000000016_S0000095	BUT THIS IS THE ONE THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE THE GAME-CHANGER GOING FORWARD AND COULD REALLY HAVE A BIG IMPACT 
YOU1000000016_S0000096	ON THE OTHER TWO OPTIONS MOVING FORWARD NOW CASTR ONCE AGAIN IS REALLY EASY TO USE 
YOU1000000016_S0000097	BUT I THINK THE BIGGEST REASON THAT CASTR IS SUPER EASY TO USE IS THAT IT'S NOT FILLED WITH ALL THE ADDITIONAL FEATURES AND BELLS AND WHISTLES 
YOU1000000016_S0000098	AS THE OTHER TWO THAT WE'VE SEEN NOW THERE'S NO ADS THERE'S NO BANDWIDTH LIMITATIONS AND THERE'S NO STREAM TIME OR LIMITS 
YOU1000000016_S0000099	ON HOW LONG YOU CAN ACTUALLY BROADCAST FOR THEY EVEN SAY ON THEIR ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT YOU COULD STREAM TWENTY-FOUR SEVEN THROUGH THEIR PLATFORM IF YOU WANTED TO 
YOU1000000016_S0000100	OTHER BIG FEATURE THAT CASTR HAS IS THE ABILITY TO DO CLOUD RECORDING SO YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO A FULL RECORDING OF WHATEVER IT IS YOU ARE LIVESTREAMING 
YOU1000000016_S0000101	WITHOUT NEEDING TO SAVE IT LOCALLY ON YOUR COMPUTER 
YOU1000000016_S0000102	AND JUST LIKE THE OTHER TWO IT DOES HAVE INTEGRATED CHAT AS WELL 
YOU1000000016_S0000103	AND THEY EVEN SHOW YOU ON THEIR WEBSITE HOW TO BRING IT INTO PLACES LIKE WIRECAST 
YOU1000000016_S0000104	NOW WHAT CASTR DOESN'T HAVE STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOX ANYWAY IS THOSE TRANSCODING AND REFORMATTING OPTIONS THAT YOU HAD IN RESTREAM AND IN SWITCHBOARD 
YOU1000000016_S0000105	BUT THEY DO HAVE ANOTHER SERVICE OFFERING THAT TIES IN WITH CASTR THAT DOES GIVE YOU ACCESS TO ALL OF THOSE THINGS IF YOU NEED THEM 
YOU1000000016_S0000106	SO NOW LOOKING AT THE PRICING OPTIONS I THINK THIS IS REALLY WHERE CASTR SHINES I HAVE A FREE PLAN WITH NO BRANDING NO WATERMARKS 
YOU1000000016_S0000107	NO RESTRICTIONS AROUND BANDWIDTH OR THE AMOUNT OF TIME YOU CAN LIVESTREAM FOR TOTALLY FREE THEY WILL LET YOU SHARE THAT OUT TO FIVE PUBLISHING LOCATIONS 
YOU1000000016_S0000108	INCLUDING ONE FACEBOOK CHANNEL THEY ALSO HAVE A NINE DOLLAR NINETY-NINE PER MONTH PLAN WHICH GIVES YOU UP TO TEN PUBLISHING LOCATIONS 
YOU1000000016_S0000109	AND TWO FACEBOOK CHANNELS AND FOR TWENTY-NINE NINETY-NINE YOU GET UNLIMITED LOCATIONS AND FIVE FACEBOOK CHANNELS 
YOU1000000016_S0000110	NOW LIKE I SAID AT THE START OF THE VIDEO WE'RE NOT GETTING INTO THE NITTY GRITTY OF EACH OF THESE THREE PLATFORMS WE ARE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING AT 
YOU1000000016_S0000111	MULTICASTING AND BROADCASTING YOUR LIVESTREAM OUT TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS THESE ARE IN MY OPINION THE BEST THREE TO DO THAT AND YOU CAN ALSO SEE 
YOU1000000016_S0000112	THAT THEY'RE ALL SO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT OFFERINGS NOW IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO IS ON THE MORE ADVANCED SIDE OF THINGS AND YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ALL THE FEATURES ALL THE CONTROLS 
YOU1000000016_S0000113	ALL THE BELLS AND WHISTLES THEN YOU'RE REALLY PROBABLY NOT GONNA BE LOOKING AT CASTR YOU'RE GONNA BE MORE LOOKING AT RESTREAM OR AT SWITCHBOARD 
YOU1000000016_S0000114	NOW OBVIOUSLY WITH THOSE TWO WHICH ONE IS GONNA BE THE BEST FIT FOR YOU YOU'VE REALLY GOTTA COME BACK TO THOSE PRICING TABLES AND SEE WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS ARE 
YOU1000000016_S0000115	AND WHAT YOU ACTUALLY GET ACCESS TO FOR THOSE DIFFERENT PLANS 
YOU1000000016_S0000116	BUT IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S NOT LOOKING FOR ALL THOSE ADVANCE FEATURES AND REALLY WANTS THE BEST BANG FOR BUCK TO BE ABLE TO GET YOUR BROADCAST OUT TO MULTIPLE PLATFORMS 
YOU1000000016_S0000117	THEN IT'S REALLY GONNA GO HANDS DOWN TO CASTR I REALLY THINK THAT WHAT THEY'RE OFFERING ESPECIALLY FOR THE PRICE AND EVEN ON THE FREE PLAN IS JUST INSANE AND IT'S 
YOU1000000016_S0000118	AGAIN IT'S EASY TO GET UP AND RUNNING AND GET IT WORKING WITH YOUR LIVESTREAMING PLATFORM SO I'M GONNA QUICKLY LOG IN TO CASTR AND SHOW YOU HOW EASY IT IS TO GET SET UP 
YOU1000000016_S0000119	ONCE YOU'RE LOGGED IN ALL YOU NEED TO DO IS GO TO ADD A STREAM AND CHOOSE NEW RESTREAM

YOU1000000020_S0000001	MAGIC GATHERING IS A COLLECTIBLE CARD GAME IT'S STRATEGIC IN NATURE IT'S GOT A LITTLE BIT OF HIDDEN INFORMATION WHERE YOU'RE HIDING YOUR CARDS FROM YOUR OPPONENT 
YOU1000000020_S0000002	YOU'RE PLAYING YOUR CARDS ONTO THE BATTLE FIELD ATTACKING AND BLOCKING WITH THEM AND TRYING TO REDUCE YOUR OPPONENT TO ZERO LIFE 
YOU1000000020_S0000003	PEOPLE COLLECT THE CARDS LIKE BASEBALL CARDS 
YOU1000000020_S0000004	THEN THEY PLAY A STRATEGY GAME WITH THEM IT'S KIND OF A COMBINATION OF POKER AND CHESS POKER IN THAT YOU PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DRAW BUT CHESS AND THEN EACH CARD'S LIKE A DIFFERENT PACE 
YOU1000000020_S0000005	FROM THE CARDS YOU COLLECT YOU GET TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR OWN DECK AND YOUR OWN EXPERIENCE AND MAKE IT YOUR OWN

YOU1000000020_S0000009	ONE OF THE THINGS THAT MAKES MAGIC ACCESSIBLE TO NEW PLAYERS IS THAT LUCK IS ABSOLUTELY GOING TO BE A FACTOR UNLIKE A GAME LIKE CHESS WHERE YOU WILL ALWAYS LOOSE IF YOU'RE WORSE 
YOU1000000020_S0000010	IN MAGIC YOU SOMETIMES WIN AND ITS KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE BIT OF A GATEWAY YOU KNOW LIKE IT HELPS YOU FEEL GOOD WHILE YOU'RE LEARNING

YOU1000000020_S0000072	FOR YOU KNOW THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO'S PLAYING IT'S MUCH MORE LIKELY A WAY THAT THEY SORT OF BLOW OFF STEAM AFTER WORK OR JUST GET TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS OR A WAY THAT THEY BOND WITH THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS

YOU1000000020_S0000092	ANOTHER REASON YOU KNOW THAT DEFINITELY LOVE THE GAME AND WHY WE PLAY VINTAGE IS THE OLDER ART WORK LIKE 
YOU1000000020_S0000093	SIR ANGELS THE CARD I HAVE AROUND SIMPLY CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS LOVED THE ART WORK 
YOU1000000020_S0000095	THIS IS THE BACKBONE OF MY DECK IT'S CALLED MISHES WORKSHOP 
YOU1000000020_S0000097	TO ME I'M VERY MUCH GRAVITATE TOWARDS THE ART I ALWAYS APPRECIATED THE FANTASY ART ASPECT 
YOU1000000020_S0000099	THERE WAS SOME EARLY PIECES OF ART WHICH HAD SOME SYMBOLISM WHICH I THINK PROVOKED PEOPLE TO BRING OUT THE BAD ASPECTS OF FANTASY 
YOU1000000020_S0000100	THERE WERE TWO CARDS IN PARTICULAR DEMONIC TUTOR AND UNHOLY STRENGTH WHICH HAD ANTIGRAMS ON THEM 
YOU1000000020_S0000102	THERE WAS SUCH NEGATIVE CONNOTATION TO RITUALISTIC ACTIVITIES OR 
YOU1000000020_S0000103	ANYTHING TO DO WITH SACRIFICES AND BURNT OFFERINGS AND ALL OF THESE TERMS JUST STARTED TO SURFACE 
YOU1000000020_S0000104	MAGIC THE GATHERING SO LET'S SEE WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM HOW MANY OF YOU SEE A PENTAGRAM IF YOU LOOK THERE IT IS 
YOU1000000020_S0000105	EXCEPTIONAL PARENTS WHY I DON'T WANT MY KIDS PLAYING THIS BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE IMAGERY 
YOU1000000020_S0000106	HERE'S ONE OF THE CARDS TILL DEAD ROTTING DECAYING THING THAT'S BEEN IN THE GROUND AND MEMBER IT SAY IT THAT IT'S AN OCCULT GAME 
YOU1000000020_S0000107	ONE OF THE DANGERS OF THIS THING IS THAT IT'S PLAYED WITH THE MIND HOW MANY KNOW THAT THE MIND IS A VERY FRAGILE THING 
YOU1000000020_S0000108	TEENAGE KIDS THEIR PARENTS STILL HAD INFLUENCE ON WHAT THEY COULD PLAY 
YOU1000000020_S0000109	NOW IT'S DIFFERENT 
YOU1000000020_S0000110	THEY QUICKLY RETRACTED THOSE PRINTINGS AND THAT REALLY QUELLED A LOT OF THE FIRES OF THE WHOLE SATANIC IMAGERY 
YOU1000000020_S0000111	THAT NEGATIVE PARADIGM AT LEAST THAT FOLLOWED MAGIC IN THE BEGINNING YEARS ARE NOW OVER AND I THINK YOU STARTING TO SEE NOW THE GROWTH OF IT IS CHANGING 
YOU1000000020_S0000113	I LOOK AT FANTASY AS ONE OF MY LITTLE ESCAPES

YOU1000000020_S0000151	THIS IS AH VINTAGE AH RIGHT NOW WE'RE DOING AH EIGHT-MEN TOURNAMENT JUST GETTING TOGETHER WITH FRIENDS AND PLAYING CARDS 
YOU1000000020_S0000153	MY CORE STRATEGY IS GENERALLY TO STOP WHAT HE WANTS TO DO SLOWLY PICTURE A BOA CONSTRICTOR 
YOU1000000020_S0000154	SLOWLY WRAPPING AROUND SOMEBODY AND ONCE HE IS IN A PERFECT POSITION NOW HE CAN SQUEEZE AT THE AIR OUT OF THEM 
YOU1000000020_S0000155	BUT I HAVE TO UP GET THE BOA CAUSE THEY HAS TO GET IN POSITION FIRST THAT'S THE BEST WAY I COULD EXPLAIN WHAT THE DECK WANTS TO DO ITS PLANNING IT OUT 
YOU1000000020_S0000156	IT'S HOW DO YOU GET THERE T'S IT'S STOPPING YOUR OPPONENT FROM DOING WHAT HE WANTS TO WHILE IT SLOWLY REELING HIM IN 
YOU1000000020_S0000158	WELL I REALLY SAY ABOUT VINTAGES IT REALLY IS HOW THE GAME WAS INTENDED TO BE PLAYED 
YOU1000000020_S0000159	IF VINTAGE IS THE AH PUREST FORM OF THE GAME IT AH PLAYS WITH ALL THE CARDS FROM ORIGINALLY PRINTED UP UNTIL THE ONE'S WHICH ARE BEING HEART OF THE PRICES 
YOU1000000020_S0000160	WIZ OF THE COASTERS THAT ARE THE CREATOR OF OF THIS GAME THEY KIND OF I GUESS BELIEVED THERE WERE ERRORS IN THE ORIGINAL CARD THAT WERE MADE 
YOU1000000020_S0000161	AND THEY KIND OF WANTED TO PUT THEM AWAY IN A SMALL PLACE WHERE THEY CAN BE FORGOTTEN ABOUT 
YOU1000000020_S0000162	THEY DEFINITELY LEFT US OUT IN THE COLD A LITTLE BIT AND THAT'S WHY AH IN THE VINTAGE COMMUNITY WE HAD TO SELF REGULATE WHY PEOPLE LOOK AT US AS THE WORLDWIDE WEST BECAUSE WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF THE CULTURE LOOK FROM THE PARENT COMPANY 
YOU1000000020_S0000163	MY OPPONENT RIGHT NOW IS A GREAT PHANTOM HE IS A VERY WELL KNOWN IN THE VINTAGE COMMUNITY WE YOU KNOW WE PUT OUT SOME REALLY GOOD PLAYERS FROM HIM 
YOU1000000020_S0000165	I GOT INTO LOOKING AT MISPRINTS OF CARDS THEY PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAUGHT AND DESTROYED BY QUALITY CONTROL BUT DIDN'T FOR EXAMPLE THESE TWO 
YOU1000000020_S0000166	THERE'S ACTUALLY NO PHYSICAL CARD HERE UM THIS HAS TOO MUCH BLUE THIS HAS TOO MUCH BLACK INK THERE ARE MISS CUT CARDS THAT COME IN PACKS MY FRIEND JUST FOUND THESE 
YOU1000000020_S0000167	WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A STORY ON IT YOU KNOW I THOUGHT THEY WERE INCREDIBLE I THOUGHT I WOULD GET THEM FRAMED AT FIRST BUT THEN EVERY TIME AN OPPORTUNITY CAME WE WANTED TO GET ANOTHER MISPRINT I DEFINITELY WANTED TO 
YOU1000000020_S0000168	ANYTHING ELSE IN THERE THAT'S WORTH SEEING

YOU1000000020_S0000177	YOU WERE TALKING EARLIER ABOUT PRO TOURS AND ALL THESE KIDS ARE KIND OF YOUNG DO YOU EVER THINK THAT YOU WOULD'VE KIND TO DO THAT 
YOU1000000020_S0000178	I TELL YOU WHAT THEY WOULD I THERE'S A PART OF ME AS BEING AN ACTUAL COMPETITOR I PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE MIND A SMALL OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DONE IT 
YOU1000000020_S0000179	I WOULD HAVE BEEN AT THE APPROPRIATE AGE RIGHT NOW WE'RE TRYING TO WIN A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP IN THIS FORMAT THAT'S THAT'S YOUR ACTUAL CALL BUT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION I WOULD'VE GIVEN IT A CHANCE

YOU1000000020_S0000186	HERE WE ARE IT'S THE LAST ROUND OF THE DAY IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS IF JACOB WILSON WINS HE ADVANCES TO THE FINAL DAY IF HE LOSES HE IS DONE 
YOU1000000020_S0000187	OUR FIRST PLAYER SETH NANFIELD STANDING IN HIS WAY JACOB WILSON 
YOU1000000020_S0000189	ALRIGHT HERE'S LAVA SPIKE TO TAKE JACOB WILSON DOWN TO TEN 
YOU1000000020_S0000191	DOWN TO TWO IS JACOB 
YOU1000000020_S0000193	JACOB'S TURNING THE TABLES AND GOING ON THE OFFENSIVE HERE HE'S GOT HIS GUNS BLAZING AGAINST SETH AND SETH HAS FALLEN TO SIX 
YOU1000000020_S0000194	THIS IS JUST ABOUT AS CLOSE AS THEY GET 
YOU1000000020_S0000196	THAT'S GAME THAT'S GONNA DO IT JACOB WILSON HAS WON 
YOU1000000020_S0000197	HE HAD A SINGLE COPY OF THAT CARD IN HIS DECK AND IT SHOWED UP AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME WHAT ARE THE ODDS 
YOU1000000020_S0000198	HOW DO YOU FEEL AS SETH NANFIELD RIGHT NOW 
YOU1000000020_S0000199	I WANNA THROW UP

YOU1000000020_S0000203	SO JACOB WAS ABOUT TO DIE TO A LETHAL BARRAGE OF BURN SPELLS AND THEN CAST A DREW HIS SINGLE COPY OF THE WHITE LEY LINE TO PROTECT HIMSELF 
YOU1000000020_S0000204	AND HIS OPPONENT HAD ONE CHANCE TO DRAW SOMETHING HE DIDN'T AND PULLED OUT THE WIN 
YOU1000000020_S0000205	FROM CANADA JACOB WILSON 
YOU1000000020_S0000207	IF I WIN THE PRO TOUR THAT WOULD BE A DEFINING MOMENT OF MY LIFE MAGIC IS THE THING I'VE PUT THE MOST EFFORT INTO AND WINNING THE PRO TOUR IS THE BIGGEST ACCOMPLISHMENT YOU CAN HAVE IN MAGIC 
YOU1000000020_S0000209	HELLO AND WELCOME TO THE LAST QUARTER FINAL OF PRO TOUR THEATRE FORGE WE ARE GONNA START OFF WITH YELGER WEGISHIMA AGAINST JACOB WILSON A NINETEEN YEAR OLD 
YOU1000000020_S0000210	RETURNING TO THE TOP EIGHT OF A MODERN PRO TOUR MADE THE FINALS LAST YEAR 
YOU1000000020_S0000211	LET'S GET RIGHT DOWN TO THE FLOOR AND SEE WHO IS GONNA WIN BETWEEN YELGER WEGISHIMA AND JACOB WILSON 
YOU1000000020_S0000213	YELGER'S HAND HAS EVERYTHING 
YOU1000000020_S0000215	JACOB IS IN GAME THREE IN A TWO OUT OF THREE AGAINST 
YOU1000000020_S0000216	YELGER WEGISHIMA WHO IS A DUTCH HALL OF FAME MAGIC PLAYER SO NOT AN EASY OPPONENT 
YOU1000000020_S0000218	GAME ONE YELGER HAD AN INSTANT WIN COMBO THAT INVOLVED MAKING AN INFINITE NUMBER OF FAIRIES THAT ALL ATTACK AT ONCE FOR INFINITE DAMAGE 
YOU1000000020_S0000219	AND THEN IN GAME TWO JACOB WAS ABLE TO SURVIVE DESPITE THE FACT THAT YELGER RAINED AN ANGER OF THE GODS THAT DESTROYED ALL OF JACOB'S CREATURES 
YOU1000000020_S0000220	BUT THEN JACOB SUMMONED AN ELEPHANT SOLDIER CALLED LOXODON SMIDER THAT FINISHED THE JOB AND KILLED YELGER IN GAME TWO SO NOW WE RE ONTO GAME THREE 
YOU1000000020_S0000221	JACOB'S GOT A VERY GOOD START BUT YELGER'S DECK IS CAPABLE OF WINNING IN AN EYE BLINK SO THE SUSPENSE IS PRETTY GOOD 
YOU1000000020_S0000223	VOICE RESEARCHES IS RUNNING THROUGH WHAT COULD HE HAVE JACOB DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF OUTS HERE THINGS ARE NOT LOOKING GOOD FOR HIM 
YOU1000000020_S0000225	GONNA PUT THIS SPLUNCHER TWIN ON THIS PESTERMITE DO YOU HAVE A RESPONSE SHOWS THE PATH TO EXILE TO YELGER WHO NOW WILL SHOW HIM THE DISBOW 
YOU1000000020_S0000226	AND THAT SHOULD BE 
YOU1000000020_S0000228	THE GAME THERE'S THE END YELGER WIGISHIMA ADVANCES TO THE SEMI FINALS OVER JACOB WILSON 
YOU1000000020_S0000230	ANOTHER GREAT PERFORMANCE FROM YOUNG JACOB WILSON BUT IT WASN'T QUITE ENOUGH AGAINST THE DUTCH HALL OF FAMER I KNOW THIS HAS TO BE SO DISAPPOINTING FOR HIM 
YOU1000000020_S0000232	YOU'RE GRADED ON HOW MANY TOP EIGHTS YOU'VE ACHIEVED I THINK THAT ULTIMATELY JACOB IS GONNA EMBRACE THAT FACT 
YOU1000000020_S0000233	AND AS HE STARTS STACKING UP MORE AND MORE TOP BASE YOU'RE GONNA SEE HIM ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE GAINED FOR MAKING TO TOP EIGHT 
YOU1000000020_S0000234	EVEN IF IT ISN'T WINNING THE TOURNAMENT AND FOR SUCH A YOUNG PERSON HE'S ALREADY OFF TO A GREAT START 
YOU1000000020_S0000236	THERE DEFINITELY IS A BALANCE OF SKILL AND LUCK IN MAGIC ANYBODY CAN WIN THE BETTER PLAYERS OFTEN GONNA WIN BUT AH THAT'S ONE OF THE MAIN APPEALS I THINK 
YOU1000000020_S0000238	HAVING A VARIETY OF EXPERIENCE IS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE ELEMENT OF CHANCE IS A HUGE PART OF JUST GAMES BE IT 
YOU1000000020_S0000240	MAGIC'S EVER CHANGING AND THE CARD ARE CONTINUING TO BE GOOD THE SETS THEY PRODUCE CONTINUE TO BE EXCELLENT AND IF THAT STOPPED THEN MAGIC WOULD TAKE A STEP BACK BUT 
YOU1000000020_S0000241	YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GONNA KEEP MAKING GREAT CARDS AND MAKING THE GAME INTERESTING AND THE GAME'S GONNA CONTINUE TO AH TO REALLY EXCEL 
YOU1000000020_S0000242	YOU KNOW MAGIC IS TWENTY YEARS OLD YOU KNOW MAGIC IS OLD ENOUGH THAT AH THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO PLAYED THE GAME WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER WHO ARE SHARING IT WITH YOU KNOW THEIR YOUNGER GENERATIONS 
YOU1000000020_S0000243	GOOD GAME G G G G OKAY YOU WANNA PLAY ANOTHER ROUND 
YOU1000000020_S0000244	YEAH LET'S GO 
YOU1000000020_S0000246	WE'VE BEEN PLAYING THIS FOR TWENTY YEARS NOW IT'S SUCH REALLY A PART OF US THAT I'M EXPECTING TO BE AT B T TOURS TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW AND I'M EXPECTING TO BE THE OLD MAN 
YOU1000000020_S0000247	AND WHEN SOMEONE LOOKS AT ME AND HE'S EIGHTEEN-TWENTY YEARS OLD AND HE SAYS OH I GUESS THIS OLD GUY DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING HE'S IN FOR A SHOCK HE'S IN FOR SURPRISE TO KNOW THAT I'M PLAYING THIS FOR FORTY YEARS 
YOU1000000020_S0000248	AS LONG AS I HAVE THE FACULTIES TO PLAY IT I WILL PLAY 
YOU1000000020_S0000250	I'M DEFINITELY ENJOYING MAGIC RIGHT NOW AND I CAN SEE PLAYING IT FOR A WHILE IF THIS YEAR DOES GO POORLY AND I DON'T MAKE PLATINUM I'D ALSO BE HAPPY TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND TRY 
YOU1000000020_S0000252	TO PUT MORE OF MY EFFORT INTO THAT 
YOU1000000020_S0000254	THIS IS THE ONE INVITATIONAL IN RICHMOND I'M HERE WITH OUR CHAMPION JACOB WILSON CONGRATULATIONS MAN WITH A HAND SHAKE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF HARDWARE YOU'RE NO STRANGER TO THIS 
YOU1000000020_S0000255	YEAH I'LL PUT THESE WITH MY OTHER ONE 
YOU1000000020_S0000257	OKAY UM SEVEN CARDS RIGHT 
YOU1000000020_S0000258	ALRIGHT SEVEN CARDS 
YOU1000000020_S0000259	IT'S REALLY FUN JUST STARTED PLAYING TODAY AND I'M DECENT 
YOU1000000020_S0000260	YOU'RE DECENT I'M A NOOB I'VE 
YOU1000000020_S0000261	WE'RE BOTH NOOBS 
YOU1000000020_S0000262	HUH BUT WE'RE OKAY 
YOU1000000020_S0000263	WE'RE TEACHING EACH OTHER KIND OF HUH 
YOU1000000020_S0000264	WE'RE LEARNING 
YOU1000000020_S0000266	YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW I JUST NEED LAND ONE LAND AND I CAN DESTROY YOU 
YOU1000000020_S0000267	YOU HAD NOTHING YOU SCRUB 
YOU1000000020_S0000268	I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT MAGIC UNTIL TODAY EXCEPT FOR THAT IT WAS A CARD GAME AND NOW I'M ALREADY OBSESSED WITH IT 
YOU1000000023_S0000001	FIRE EMBLEM THIS MAGNIFICENT FRANCHISE PUSHES THE BOUNDARIES OF GAMING BY DARING TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT IF CHESS MADE YOU HORNY 
YOU1000000023_S0000002	FIRE EMBLEM IS TURNING THIRTY NEXT YEAR AND WITH SIXTEEN MAIN GAMES AND A FEW SPINOFFS IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT IT HAS GROWN INTO SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY THE GAMES ARE PACKED WITH DEEP STORY LINES AND MEMORABLE CHARACTERS LIKE MARTH 
YOU1000000023_S0000003	THAT'S NOT MARTH MARTH THAT'S WHICH ONE IS MARTH 
YOU1000000023_S0000005	MARTH 
YOU1000000023_S0000006	THE PROBLEM WITH HAVING SUCH A PROLIFIC SERIES IS THAT THE CHARACTERS START TO BLEND TOGETHER ONE NEEDS ONLY TO LOOK AT THE SUPER SMASH BROS ROSTER TO SEE THAT FIRE EMBLEM CHARACTERS ARE A BIT HARD TO DIFFERENTIATE 
YOU1000000023_S0000007	AH IT'S LIKE TRYING TO REMEMBER YOUR COWORKERS NAMES AFTER MEETING THEM ONCE AT A WORK MIXER EXCEPT IN THIS CASE YOUR COWORKERS ALL HAVE SWORDS AND CAN ONLY MAKE ONE FACIAL EXPRESSION 
YOU1000000023_S0000009	BUT DO NOT WORRY THERE IS AN ANSWER TO THIS CONUNDRUM BECAUSE TODAY I'M GOING TO TEACH YOU HOW TO TELL APART EVERY FIRE EMBLEM CHARACTER 
YOU1000000023_S0000011	MY FACE IS JUST NOT BUILT FOR THIS EXPRESSION 
YOU1000000023_S0000012	FIRST STEP IN THIS PROCESS IS TO COLLECT A LIST OF THE CHARACTERS TURNS OUT EVEN AFTER TRIMMING THE NON-PLAYABLE ONES AND THE ONES FROM THE TOKYO MIRAGE SESSIONS THERE ARE NEARLY SIX HUNDRED FIRE EMBLEM CHARACTERS 
YOU1000000023_S0000013	I CANNOT EXPLAIN THAT MANY CHARACTERS I HAVE MADE THAT MISTAKE BEFORE TRYING TO CATEGORIZE ALL SIX HUNDRED CASTLEVANIA MONSTERS WAS A BAD IDEA BUT THE BEAUTY OF MAKING MISTAKES IS THAT YOU CAN LEARN FROM THEM 
YOU1000000023_S0000014	AND I NOW UNDERSTAND THAT EXPLAINING SIX HUNDRED DISCRETE CHARACTERS WOULDN'T ACTUALLY BE HELPFUL HUMAN BEINGS AREN'T MEANT TO REMEMBER SIX HUNDRED PEOPLE PERFECTLY IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST TRY TO REMEMBER SOMETHING ABOUT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN YOUR CONTACT LIST 
YOU1000000023_S0000015	I HAVE A CONTACT FOR SOMEONE NAME ZAIN AND IN THE COMPANY IT JUST SAYS BOCCE BALL 
YOU1000000023_S0000017	WHO THE FUCK IS THIS BUT UNLIKE MY CONTACT LIST FIRE EMBLEM'S HAVE PLOTLINES AND IN MY EXPERIENCE PLAYING THESE GAMES I NOTICED THAT A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT CHARACTERS FIT SIMILAR ROLES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE GAMES 
YOU1000000023_S0000018	AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S NOTICED THIS ON THE FIRE EMBLEM WIKI THERE IS A WHOLE LIST OF ARCHETYPES BASED ON DIFFERENT CHARACTERS A LIST THAT I ONLY FOUND AFTER SPENDING A WHOLE DAY TRYING TO CATEGORIZE THEM ON MY OWN 
YOU1000000023_S0000019	AND IT'S JUST SO FUN TO REALIZE THAT YOU'VE WASTED A WHOLE DAY OF WORK BUT THIS LIST INTRIGUED ME STOCK CHARACTERS IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES PLAYING AGAIN AND AGAIN IN DIFFERENT STORIES 
YOU1000000023_S0000020	DOES THAT REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING OF COURSE IT DOES IT REMINDS YOU OF THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE BECAUSE IT REMINDS ME OF THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE AND IT'S SO OBVIOUSLY THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE THAT I DON'T NEED TO EXPLAIN IT 
YOU1000000023_S0000021	BUT I WILL FOR THE SAKE OF EXTENDING THIS VIDEO THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE WAS AN ITALIAN FORM OF THEATER THAT WAS BIG IN THE SIXTEENTH TO EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES AND IT RELIED ON STOCK CHARACTERS WEARING MASKS OR COSTUMES TO DESIGNATE WHO THEY WERE 
YOU1000000023_S0000022	THAT WAY THE AUDIENCE COULD BE LIKE AH THAT DUDE'S WEARING A TIGHT FITTING SUIT WITH A BUNCH OF WEIRD PATCHES THAT MUST BE ARLECCHINO THE SERVANT CLOWN SOMETIMESTO TWO MASTERS THIS BROUGHT THE AUDIENCE IN IMMEDIATELY THEY KNEW WHAT THAT CHARACTER WAS ABOUT WITHOUT ANY EXPOSITION 
YOU1000000023_S0000023	IN THE SAME WAY FIRE EMBLEM HAS DOZENS OF RECURRING CHARACTERS THAT GET YOU THROUGH EACH GAME AND THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO TELL THEM APART BY DEFINING THEIR ARCHETYPES 
YOU1000000023_S0000024	FIRE EMBLEM GOES ONE STEP FURTHER BECAUSE THESE CHARACTERS CAN NOT ONLY SERVE THE SAME STORY PURPOSE BUT THEY CAN HAVE A SIMILAR ROLE IN THE GAME PLAY 
YOU1000000023_S0000025	AND THIS GOES TO PROVE MY THEORY THAT FIRE EMBLEM IS NOT ONLY THE SPIRITUAL SUCCESSOR TO COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE IT IS ITS NATURAL EVOLUTION AN ELEVATED FORM I CALL THE COMMEDIA DELL'ANIME 
YOU1000000023_S0000026	THE NEWER MORE PERFECT FORM OF THEATER WE JUST HAVE TO BOIL DOWN THE FIRE EMBLEM PERSONNEL INTO SYRUPY STOCK CHARACTERS LET'S BEGIN WITH THE ARCHETYPES THAT ARE STANDARD 
YOU1000000023_S0000027	CAIN AND ABEL ARE BATTLE BROS THEY FIGHT TOGETHER BUT NOT IN THE BIBLICAL SENSE BORD AND CORDS ARE SIMILAR EXCEPT THEY'RE USUALLY AXE FIGHTERS PEGASUS SISTERS ARE A TRIO OF FLYING HORSES LADIES 
YOU1000000023_S0000028	YOU CAN'T SPLIT THESE ARCHETYPES UP INTO THEIR SOLO CHARACTERS BECAUSE THEIR BOND IS WHAT DEFINES THEM YOU CAN'T HAVE A WALUIGI WITHOUT A LUIGI AND IN THE SAME WAY YOU CAN'T HAVE A BORD WITHOUT A CORD WHICH IS MY FAVORITE DOCTOR SEUSS BOOK 
YOU1000000023_S0000029	JAGENS ARE MENTORS THAT ARE STRONG IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN YOU'LL QUICKLY OUTPACE THEM AND IT'S KIND OF SAD LIKE THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT YOUR DAD IN A BASKETBALL GAME OIFEYS ARE SIMILAR TO JAGENS EXCEPT THEY'LL KEEP DUNKING ON YOU TILL YOU'RE DEAD 
YOU1000000023_S0000030	WENDELLS ARE MENTORS BUT FOR MAGIC GOTOHS ARE MENTORS BUT ONLY THE LAST HALF OF THE GAME BEOWOLFS ARE MERCENARIES THAT YOU HAVE TO PAY ACTUAL IN GAME CURRENCY TO RECRUIT AND OGMAS ARE MERCENARIES THAT USUALLY DECIDE TO JOIN YOU OUT OF THEIR OWN VOLITION 
YOU1000000023_S0000031	WHICH IS BY DEFINITION NOT A MERCENARY NAVARRES ARE SILENT MOODY SWORD SWINGERS KIND OF LIKE IF THAT PERSON WHO SAID THEY STUDIED THE BLADE ACTUALLY STUDIED THE BLADE THERE ARE ALSO A BUNCH OF VILLAINS BUT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS 
YOU1000000023_S0000032	POWER AMBITION LOYALTY WYVERN RIDING I GUESS AND GETTING POSSESSED WHICH IS A CLASSIC MISTAKE 
YOU1000000023_S0000033	SOME ARCHETYPES ARE BASED ON THEIR GAME PLAY REQUIREMENTS VERY DIFFICULT TO RECRUIT USUALLY RECRUITED AFTER THEY'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED LATE GAME RECRUITS THAT COULD BE GOOD BUT YOU HAVE TO WORK HARD SUPER LOW LEVEL VILLAGERS THAT COULD ALSO BE GOOD AND IF YOU RECRUIT ONE OF THESE PAIRS 
YOU1000000023_S0000034	YOU CAN'T GET THE OTHER KIND OF LIKE IF TWO OF YOUR FRIENDS START DATING AND THEN HAVE A REALLY MESSY BREAKUP CORNELIUSES ARE USUALLY THE PARENTAL FIGURE TO THE MAIN CHARACTER AND THEY HAVE THIS NASTY HABIT OF GETTING AXED SUPER EARLY ON IN THE GAME 
YOU1000000023_S0000035	IT'S KIND OF LIKE FIRE EMBLEM DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE INTERESTING CHARACTERS WITHOUT MAKING THEM SUFFER TRAUMATIC PARENTAL DEATH 
YOU1000000023_S0000037	TACTICIANS YOUNG FEMALE MAGES YOUNG FEMALE HEALERS YOUNG MALE MAGES 
YOU1000000023_S0000039	THIEVES 
YOU1000000023_S0000041	JEORGES DO THAT THING WHERE THEY PRETEND TO BE NOT IMPORTANT AND THEN SURPRISE I WASN'T AN OLD CRONE I WAS A MAGICAL WITCH THE WHOLE TIME EXCEPT THEY'RE NOT VERY GOOD AT HIDING THE FACT THAT THEY'RE IMPORTANT AND THE CREEPY VERSION OF THE JEORGES THE TIKIS 
YOU1000000023_S0000042	USUALLY THEY TAKE THE FORM OF A SMALL GIRL OR ADOLESCENT EXCEPT THEY'RE REALLY FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OLD AND A GOD OR A DRAGON AND I HONESTLY DO NOT HAVE THE TIME TO UNPACK THIS BULLSHIT 
YOU1000000023_S0000043	THESE TWENTY-NINE ARCHETYPES ARE USEFUL BUT THEY ONLY COVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY-NINE CHARACTERS THERE ARE STILL THREE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SEVEN TO GO IF WE KEEP THIS UP WE'RE GOING TO END UP WITH SEVENTY-FIVE ARCHETYPES 
YOU1000000023_S0000044	THE COMMEDIA DELL'ARTE ONLY HAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN SO BEFORE WE MOVE ON LET'S COMBINE SOME THESE SIX ARE ALL MENTORS TO VARYING DEGREES OF USEFULNESS THESE ARE ALL DEFINED BY THEIR VILLAINY AND ONLY SOME OF THEM BECOME PLAYABLE 
YOU1000000023_S0000045	WELCOME TO CAIN SIBLINGS INCORPORATED WHERE WE ALL HAVE A SIBLING LIKE BOND AND DO THE SAME JOB THESE ALL HAVE VERY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR RECRUITING THESE BOTH DO THAT THING WHERE THEY DON'T SEEM IMPORTANT AND THEN SURPRISE I'M IMPORTANT 
YOU1000000023_S0000046	THESE ARE ALL HARD TO MAKE GOOD BUT THEY'RE WORTH IT IF YOU PUT THE EFFORT IN THESE ARE ALL PRECOCIOUS LITTLE MAGIC BABIES AND THAT LEAVES THE NAVARRES UNCONNECTED BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I'M CHANGING THE ARCHETYPE TO SPICY SWORDS 
YOU1000000023_S0000047	BECAUSE WE CAN INCLUDE SO MANY OTHER CHARACTERS IF WE JUST EXPAND THE DEFINITIONS TO ANY SWORD WIELDER WHO'S A LITTLE SPICY 
YOU1000000023_S0000048	IN FACT BY COMBINING THESE OTHER ARCHETYPES THERE ARE NOW TONS OF OTHER CHARACTERS WHO FIT INTO THESE EXPANDED DEFINITIONS WE ARE LEFT WITH TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY-EIGHT CHARACTERS TO CATEGORIZE 
YOU1000000023_S0000049	BUT BEFORE I GET THERE I JUST WANT TO COMMEND FIRE EMBLEM FOR HAVE FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETY-SIX PLAYABLE CHARACTERS AND ONLY REPEATING THREE NAMES WHEN I WAS HIRED FOR MY FIRST JOB AT A CLIMBING GYM I WAS ONE OF FIVE EMPLOYEES NAMED BRIAN 
YOU1000000023_S0000050	AND IT WAS A SMALL GYM BUT I GUESS IT'S PRETTY EASY TO CUT OUT REPETITIONS WHEN YOU USE DOPE-ASS NAMES LIKE SKRIMIR DAGDAR SLEUF FJORM BELF 
YOU1000000023_S0000052	I COULD GO ON ALL DAY BUT I WON'T BECAUSE IT'S TIME TO GET THE REST OF THE ARCHETYPES ON THE WALL 
YOU1000000023_S0000054	THAT TOOK LIKE THIRTY MINUTES BUT LET'S BEGIN THE HONORABLE KNIGHT LIKE FIONA WHO CARES PASSIONATELY ABOUT HER PEOPLE AND WILL ALWAYS OPPOSE CRUELTY TO CIVILIANS 
YOU1000000023_S0000055	WHICH IS WAY BETTER THAN THE LOYAL KNIGHT LIKE TROUDE WHO ONLY IS LOYAL TO PERNE AND WILL DO LITERALLY ANYTHING FOR HIM EVEN THOUGH PERNE IS A BAD DUDE BUT I'LL GET TO THAT LATER 
YOU1000000023_S0000056	THESE FOUR ARCHETYPES ARE CALM AND ALOOF AND THE ONLY THING THAT DIFFERENTIATES THEM IS HOW MUCH YOU WOULD WANT TO INVITE THEM TO YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY I'M JUST GONNA GET THE BLANK SLATE ARCHETYPE OUT OF THE WAY NOW BECAUSE FIRE EMBLEM IS A GAME WITH PERMADEATH 
YOU1000000023_S0000057	AND SO SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED MORE MEAT FOR THE GRINDER YOU KNOW SIMILAR TO THE BLANK SLATE IS THE PROTAGONIST WHICH IS ALWAYS RELATIVELY HEROIC BUT SINCE THEY'RE A CONDUIT FOR THE PLAYER THEY'RE ALL PRETTY VAGUE 
YOU1000000023_S0000058	I REALIZE THAT BY SMOOSHING THEM ALL TOGETHER INTO ONE CATEGORY I'VE MADE THE MAJORITY OF THE FIRE EMBLEM ROSTER IN SUPER SMASH INDISTINGUISHABLE 
YOU1000000023_S0000059	BUT THAT'S NOT MY FAULT SUPER SMASH SHOULD'VE INCLUDED MORE MAGIC BABIES ARROGANTS HOTHEADS AND EDGELORDS ALL HAVE A MEAN SIDE BUT ARROGANTS LIKE VAIKE JUST THINK THEY'RE THE BEST HOTHEADS LIKE CASPAR WANT TO FIGHT ANYTHING THAT MOVES 
YOU1000000023_S0000060	AND EDGELORDS LIKE NILES RETWEET JOKER ACCOUNTS UNIRONICALLY A LOT OF THESE CHARACTERS HAVE ROUGH CHILDHOODS BUT THEN TURN OUT CHEERFUL DESPITE THAT AND THEN THERE'S THE INFERIORITY COMPLEX ARCHETYPE WHICH I COULD HAVE JUST CALLED THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN IN FIRE EMBLEM FATES 
YOU1000000023_S0000061	PERFECTIONISTS MISCHIEF MAKERS AND FLIRTS ARE ALL HIGHLY MOTIVATED BUT SUBAKI IS MOTIVATED TO MEET HIGH EXPECTATIONS CLAUDE IS MOTIVATED TO MAKE INTRICATE SCHEMES AND SYLVAIN IS MOTIVATED TO BE A FUCCBOI

YOU1000000035_S0000087	MINUS THIRTY YEAH AND OF COURSE THEY CROP THE EARS OUT THERE BECAUSE THEY CAN GET FROSTBITE AND ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS TO GO IS THE EARS UM 
YOU1000000035_S0000088	AS WELL OF COURSE IF THEY COME INTO A CONFRONTATION WITH A WOLF A WOLF WILL LATCH ON TO ANYTHING THAT'S HANGING OFF SO LIKE THE EARS THIS IS THE ONLY COLOR THEY COME IN THEN I PRESUME

YOU1000000035_S0000098	IT MIGHT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT IF YOU GET RECALL FROM YOUR KANGAL YOU'LL GO DOWN IN HISTORY 
YOU1000000035_S0000100	WHEN THEY GO IT'S GOSH AND THEY PULL THEY REALLY PULL 
YOU1000000035_S0000101	THEY HAVE GREATER STRENGTH THAN WHAT THEY SEEM TO BE IN SIZE

YOU1000000035_S0000103	A FENCED GARDEN

YOU1000000035_S0000112	NO THEY SURVIVE THEY SURVIVE ON QUITE SMALL AMOUNT OF FOOD 
YOU1000000035_S0000113	MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE OF THEIR BREEDING AND THEIR YOU KNOW HAVING TO BE UP IN THE MOUNTAINS 
YOU1000000035_S0000115	LATER THAT WEEK I DROPPED BY TO MEET A VERY SPECIAL LADY INDEED SHEILA REED RESPECTED ACROSS THE U K FOR HER EXPERTISE IN THE KANGAL BREED 
YOU1000000035_S0000116	BOTH HER AND HER HUSBAND MICHAEL HAD KEPT KANGALS FOR DECADES NOW AND HAD TRAVELED OUT TO TURKEY MANY TIMES TO SOURCE DOGS FROM WORKING LINES 
YOU1000000035_S0000117	IF THERE WAS ANYONE WHO KNEW THE KANGAL BETTER THEN IT WOULD BE HER 
YOU1000000035_S0000118	WE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE BREED 
YOU1000000035_S0000120	OUR OLD DOG HAD DIED AND WE JUST WANTED WE WANTED A NATURAL DOG WE WENT TO SEE A LADY CALLED MRS BETTY MARSHALL 
YOU1000000035_S0000121	AND SHE BOUGHT OUR HER DOG CALLED FENNER HE STOOD ON HIS BACK LEGS AND HE PUT HIS PAWS ON MY SHOULDERS 
YOU1000000035_S0000123	AND HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE 
YOU1000000035_S0000125	AND HE LOOKED RIGHT INTO MY SOUL 
YOU1000000035_S0000127	AND THAT WAS IT 
YOU1000000035_S0000129	THE TURKISH PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY CAME WITH THEM AS THEY MOVED UP THROUGH INTO TURKEY THEY'VE BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS THE TURKISH PEOPLE WILL TELL YOU THAT THEY CAME WITH THEM AS THEY MOVED UP THROUGH INTO TURKEY THEY'VE BEEN USED FOR THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
YOU1000000035_S0000130	AND IT IS THEIR ROLE TO PROTECT WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY LIVE WITH THAT'S WHAT THEY DO NATURALLY 
YOU1000000035_S0000131	IF YOU GO INTO TURKEY AND YOU GO INTO THE VILLAGES YOU'LL SEE THE OLD DOGS AND IF THEY'RE NO LONGER FIT 
YOU1000000035_S0000132	YOU KNOW AND AND YOUNG OUT WITH THE FLOCK THEY ACTUALLY CAN'T STAY IN THE VILLAGES AND WHEN THE CHILDREN START TO WANDER OFF 
YOU1000000035_S0000133	YOU'LL ACTUALLY SEE THE OLD DOGS GO AH AND HEAVE THEMSELVES TO THEIR FEET BUT THEY WILL GO OFF WITH THE CHILDREN 
YOU1000000035_S0000134	TO ENSURE THAT THE CHILDREN ARE NEVER ALONE AND THEY ARE THEIR GUARDIAN SO THEY DON'T MARCH UP AND DOWN BEING AGGRESSIVE 
YOU1000000035_S0000135	THEY JUST WANDER QUIETLY ALONG MAKING SURE THE CHILDREN ARE SAFE CERTAINLY UM THE THE THE KANGAL DOG COULD KILL A WOLF WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM AT ALL 
YOU1000000035_S0000136	IF YOU WATCH THE KANGAL DOGS WHEN WHEN THEY'RE YOUNG PUPPIES THEIR MOTHER TEACHES THEM IN PLAY AND THEY WILL USE THEIR SHOULDERS TO CHARGE 
YOU1000000035_S0000137	THEY DON'T ALWAYS WIN WE HAD A VERY VERY SAD STORY WE WENT OUT ON A UM VACCINATION PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND AND THREE I THINK IT WAS 
YOU1000000035_S0000138	ONE DAY WE WENT UP TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN TO THIS VILLAGE FIRST AND THERE WERE ONLY THREE PUPPIES 
YOU1000000035_S0000139	AND THAT WAS BECAUSE PREVIOUS WEEK THERE WAS A BIG BIG UM PACK OF WOLVES HAD COME INTO THE VILLAGE IN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
YOU1000000035_S0000140	AND THE MALES HAD GONE OUT AND WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IS THEY'D GONE INTO ATTACK MODE WITH THE WITH THE WOLVES 
YOU1000000035_S0000141	THE WOLVES BASICALLY WERE WINNING 
YOU1000000035_S0000143	SO THE PEOPLE OF THE VILLAGE GOT THEIR BURNING STAVES AND AND GO OUT BUT THE MOTHER OF THESE PUPPIES BUT BEEN IN A SHED WITH THE PUPPIES 
YOU1000000035_S0000144	WHEN SHE COULD HEAR THAT THAT THINGS WERE GOING BADLY BECAUSE IT IS USUALLY THE BITCH THAT KILLS THE WOLVES NOT THE MALES SHE'D BROKEN FREE 
YOU1000000035_S0000146	AND LEFT THE PUPPIES LOCKED IN IN A SAFE PLACE AND GONE OUT SO BETWEEN HER AND THE VILLAGERS THE WOLVES WERE CHASED AWAY 
YOU1000000035_S0000147	BUT ALL OF THE MALES WERE DEAD BUT SHE WAS SEVERELY DAMAGED THEY DO TAKE ENORMOUS CARE OF THE DOGS 
YOU1000000035_S0000148	AND THEY WORKED VERY HARD ON HER BUT UNFORTUNATELY SHE DIDN'T SURVIVE AND ALL THEY'VE GOT LEFT WERE THESE THREE PUPPIES AND THE VILLAGERS WERE ABSOLUTELY HEARTBROKEN 
YOU1000000035_S0000149	BUT THE TURKS DON'T RECOGNIZE ANY DOG CALLED AN ANATOLIAN SHEPHERD DOG 
YOU1000000035_S0000150	TO THEM THE WORD ANATOLIAN SHEPHERD THEY DON'T ACCEPT THE WORD ANATOLIAN BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THAT A PLATEAU IN IN TURKEY IT'S A IT'S A NOTHINGNESS 
YOU1000000035_S0000151	IT WAS A WORD THAT WAS TAKEN UP BY THE AMERICANS TO TO GIVE IT A A NAME 
YOU1000000035_S0000152	AND BASICALLY IT'S IT'S A WORD THAT COVERS ANY BIG DOG THAT COMES FROM TURKEY ANY DOG OVER TWENTY-FOUR INCHES THAT COMES OUT OF TURKEY 
YOU1000000035_S0000153	SO IT COULD BE ANY COLOUR ANY COAT LENGTH ANYTHING REALLY WHEREAS THE KANGAL DOG IS A PARTICULAR TYPE 
YOU1000000035_S0000154	IF YOU LOOK AT AN ANATOLIAN SHEPHERD DOG SOME OF THEM LOOK LIKE KANGAL DOGS BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM MIGHT HAVE IN THEIR BACKGROUND A GRANDFATHER OR GRANDMOTHER 
YOU1000000035_S0000156	THEY'RE NOT A DOG FOR SOMEBODY WHO WANTS A DOG THAT THEY CAN WANDER DOWN THE ROAD AND GO TO THE LOCAL PARK AND LET THEM OFF FULLY TO PLAY WITH ALL THE OTHER DOGS 
YOU1000000035_S0000157	THEY'D BE FINE WHEN THEY WERE PUPPIES BUT WHAT WOULD BE HAPPENING IS GRADUALLY THAT PARK WOULD BECOME THEIRS IF THEY WENT THERE EVERY DAY OR ONCE A WEEK GRADUALLY AS THEY GREW UP 
YOU1000000035_S0000158	THAT WOULD BE THEIR PARK AND SO THEY WOULD CONSIDER THAT EVERYBODY WITHIN THAT PARK WERE PEOPLE WHO NEEDED TO ABIDE BY CERTAIN BEHAVIOR 
YOU1000000035_S0000159	PANS CIVILIZED BEHAVIOR PANS IF SOME STUPID DOG COMES UP TO IT GROWLING AND SNAPPING AND SNARLING AND BITING AT HIS FACE 
YOU1000000035_S0000161	A KANGAL DOG WILL JUST 
YOU1000000035_S0000163	DO DOG BEHAVIOR AND HE WILL STAND COMPLETELY STATUE-LIKE WHICH IS DOG LANGUAGE FOR YOUR BEHAVIOR IS UNACCEPTABLE PLEASE STOP 
YOU1000000035_S0000164	BUT IF THAT DOESN'T WORK HE WILL FOLLOW THROUGH 
YOU1000000035_S0000166	IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS 
YOU1000000035_S0000167	UNTIL IT GETS TO THE POINT WHERE HE HAS TO DO WHAT ANIMAL BEHAVIOR INSISTS THAT HE MUST DO WHICH IS TO PICK IT UP AND GIVE IT A GOOD THUMPING 
YOU1000000035_S0000168	WHICH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE IN TODAY'S MODERN WORLD IN TODAY'S MODERN WORLD THAT WILL MAKE HIM A DANGEROUS DOG WHICH HE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND 
YOU1000000035_S0000169	BECAUSE AS FAR AS HE'S CONCERNED HE'S HE'S FOLLOWED ALL THE PATTERNS YOU KNOW I'VE TRIED AND I'VE BEEN VERY CIVILIZED I'VE SAID 
YOU1000000035_S0000170	DON'T DO THAT I'VE SAID I TOLD YOU NOT TO DO THAT YOU KNOW I'VE FOLLOWED ALL THE BEHAVIOR LINES 
YOU1000000035_S0000172	IT ISN'T JUST PHYSICAL STRENGTH YOU NEED THEM TO KNOW WHAT YOU WANT THEM TO DO 
YOU1000000035_S0000173	WHEN WE HAD OUR FIRST DOGS THEY KNEW THAT I DIDN'T WANT THEM TO BEHAVE IN A CERTAIN WAY AT A CERTAIN PLACE WHAT THEY DID KNOW WAS 
YOU1000000035_S0000174	THEY HAD SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY COULD DO THAT ALWAYS OUR DOGS HAVE HAD SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY COULD GUARD 
YOU1000000035_S0000175	OUR DOGS HERE WE'VE GOT A BRIDLEWAY THEY GUARD THEY GOT THEY RUN UP AND DOWN AND THEY SHOUT AND THEY SCREAM IF ANYBODY GOES BY THAT'S WHAT THEY DO 
YOU1000000035_S0000176	WHEN WE GO OUT FROM HERE THEY KNOW THAT THAT BEHAVIOR IS NOT ACCEPTABLE 
YOU1000000035_S0000177	WE DO NOT HAVE A DOG BARKING AND GROWLING AND SCREAMING IN A CAR AND WE MAKE THAT CLEAR FROM AN EARLY AGE 
YOU1000000035_S0000179	THEY'RE NOT A DOG THAT GOES AROUND WITH THEIR SLEEVES ROLLED UP LOOKING FOR TROUBLE AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE LIKE THAT AND THAT IS NOT WHAT SOMEBODY SHOULD BE WANTING 
YOU1000000035_S0000180	THEY ARE NOT AGGRESSIVE WHAT THEY ARE IS THEY ARE THERE TO TAKE CARE OF YOU 
YOU1000000035_S0000182	THEY ARE MY HEART AND SOUL AND THEY WILL GIVE YOU THEIR HEART AND THEIR SOUL THEY DON'T HOLD BACK EVER THERE'S THERE'S NO HALF WAYS THEY'RE AN ALL OR NOTHING DOG 
YOU1000000035_S0000184	AND THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH ME I'M AN ALL OR NOTHING PERSON 
YOU1000000035_S0000185	AND THAT'S WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THEM 
YOU1000000035_S0000187	I WAS DEEPLY MOVED BY SHEILA'S STORIES AND FOUND OUT INFORMATION I DID NOT PREVIOUSLY KNOW SUCH AS THERE BEING VARYING TYPES OF KANGAL 
YOU1000000035_S0000188	SOME LARGE SOME MORE LARGE-HEADED SOME WITH MORE TOES AND SOME FAR MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN OTHERS 
YOU1000000035_S0000189	WHAT WAS CLEAR THOUGH WAS HER DEEP UNWAVERING LOVE AND RESPECT OF THIS BREED A BREED THAT SHE WAS KEEN TO NOT HAVE MISREPRESENTED 
YOU1000000035_S0000190	A BREED THAT WOULD LOVE AND LOOK AFTER YOU WITH ITS SOUL AND ONE THAT SHE WANTED TO BE EMBRACED BY THE WORLD 
YOU1000000035_S0000191	SHE BACKED UP MY CONCLUSION THAT A WOLF CAN KILL A KANGAL BUT EQUALLY IF THE CONDITIONS WERE RIGHT A KANGAL COULD KILL A WOLF 
YOU1000000035_S0000192	THE WOLVES OF TURKEY AND THE SURROUNDING AREAS ARE MUCH SMALLER THAN NORTH AMERICAN TIMBER WOLVES AND THIS SMALL SIZE WOULD EQUATE FOR WHY THEY ARE KILLED FROM TIME TO TIME 
YOU1000000035_S0000193	BUT EQUALLY IT WAS CLEAR THAT WOLVES REGULARLY KILLED THE KANGALS HOWEVER WHAT WAS MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE DOG'S ROLE 
YOU1000000035_S0000194	AS IF MORE FLOCK GUARDIANS WERE USE THE WORLD AROUND 
YOU1000000035_S0000195	THEN THERE WOULD BE LESS LICENSED WOLF CULLS AS FARMERS COULD THEN PROTECT THEIR SHEEP IN THE FAIR AND NATURAL WAY 
YOU1000000035_S0000196	ALLOWING WOLVES TO COEXIST IN THE LANDS THEY ALL ONCE ROAMED BEFORE INDUSTRIAL FARMING 
YOU1000000035_S0000197	SHEILA ALSO NICELY CLEARED UP THE KANGAL VERSUS ANATOLIAN SHEPHERD DEBATE AND EXPLAINED WHY THESE TWO DOG BREEDS ARE CERTAINLY NOT THE SAME

YOU1000000038_S0000022	BUT LIKE THIS Q B SAID THIS IS A YOUNG TEAM AND THEY HAVE TO FIND THEIR COMFORT LEVEL AND THEIR SCRIMMAGE ON FRIDAY THE LIONS HAD SOME MISTAKES ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BALL 
YOU1000000038_S0000023	THE PROGRAM ITSELF HAS NOT A ONE A REGIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP IN A COUPLE YEARS AND FOR THIS TEAM TO GET BACK TO THE TOP OF THE FOOTBALL CHAIN 
YOU1000000038_S0000024	THEY NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY HAVE SOME NEW FACES THE LIONS HAVE THE ATHLETIC ABILITY BUT WE KNOW FOOTBALL IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT ATHLETIC ABILITY SPENCER IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MENTAL GAME AS WELL 
YOU1000000038_S0000025	I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT TOO I MEAN YOU LOOK AT THEY DID HAVE A COUPLE MISTAKES EARLY ON BUT I ACTUALLY LIKED WHAT I SAW THIS TEAM THE FACT IS YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT EARLY IN THE FIRST SCRIMMAGE THOUGH WHILE THOUGH THERE WORK THROUGH THAT GET YOURSELF BETTER 
YOU1000000038_S0000026	AND WHAT I REALLY WAS IMPRESSED WAS BRADLEY HOW CALM AND COMPOSED HE WAS THROUGHOUT THAT INTERVIEW THROUGHOUT THE GAME 
YOU1000000038_S0000027	IF YOU CAN GET THAT FROM YOUR SENIOR LEADERSHIP ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S ON QUARTERBACK YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE TO WIN A BALL GAME ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL GAMES

YOU1000000038_S0000032	THE KNIGHTS WERE DOING THIS ALL DAY CONTROLLING THE GAME AT THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE THAT'S THE QUARTERBACK RUNNING DOWN AND REALLY HAVING THEIR WAY WITH THE OTHER TEAMS 
YOU1000000038_S0000033	AND THE SEAHAWKS HAD QUESTIONS ON WHO WOULD BE THE NUMBER ONE RUNNING BACK BUT THEY GOT A FEW CONTRIBUTIONS FROM A FEW GUYS AND LOOK AT THAT GUY JUST GO COMMITTEE AND NOW THE WOODBRIDGE SHOWED THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THE BIG PLAY ESPECIALLY THIS GUY 
YOU1000000038_S0000035	I THINK IT WAS A QUARTERBACK SCRIMMAGES ESPECIALLY FOR THE RAIDERS 
YOU1000000038_S0000036	THAT WOULD 
YOU1000000038_S0000037	THIS GROUP WAS ACTUALLY I WORKED SUPER HARD IN CAMP WE HAVE WE'VE TIGHTENED THE BOLTS DOWN A LITTLE BIT OF CAMP FROM LAST YEAR AND PREVIOUS YEARS

YOU1000000038_S0000042	AND THE THING IS IT LOOKS LIKE THEY HAVE MULTIPLE GUYS THAT CAN DO IT I MEAN THEY HAD A COUPLE GUYS OUT THERE THAT WERE REALLY RUNNING THE BALL PRETTY HARD 
YOU1000000038_S0000043	AND THE FACT IS AH AH I MEAN STEVEN DECATUR THAT IS THEY HAD GUYS THAT THEY WERE HANDING THE BALL OFF YOU WERE RUNNING HARD DOWNHILL AND THEY ALSO HAD A GUY THAT WAS ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY POUNDS AND HE WAS LAYING GUYS OUT I MEAN HE WAS PICKING UP YARDS YOU WANT ABOUT FALLING FORWARD TO GET THE FIRST DOWN

YOU1000000038_S0000111	I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE GONNA BE A QUALITY PROGRAM BUT WHAT SCARES ME THE FACT THEY ONLY HAVE THREE SENIORS AND THEY'RE GONNA BE RELYING ON A LOT OF UNPROVEN TEAMS THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY CAN'T DO IT BUT THE FACT IS THOSE GUYS HAVEN'T HAD THE MINUTES YET THEY HAVEN'T PROVEN THEY CAN PLAY THIS LEVEL SO THERE'S STILL SOME QUESTION MARKS MOVING FORWARD 
YOU1000000038_S0000112	I MEAN YOU ARE RIGHT HAVING ONLY THREE SENIORS IS A LITTLE WORRISOME BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO LOOK PAST THAT NUMBER AND SEE THE GROUP AS A WHOLE AND YOU KNOW GROWING PAINS ARE ACTUALLY NORMAL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND THIS TEAM LOOKS READY TO STEP IT UP TO THE NEXT LEVEL

YOU1000000040_S0000010	WE'RE STARTING OUR FOOD HUNTING DAY OVER ON THE ASIAN SIDE OF ISTANBUL AND THE FIRST THING WE ARE GOING TO EAT IS A THING CALLED LAHMACUN SO LAHMACUN YOU'LL OFTEN SEE DESCRIBED AS TURKISH PIZZA BUT IT IS NOTHING ALIKE IT 
YOU1000000040_S0000011	IT HAS ITS REALLY OWN UNIQUE IDENTITY AND IT IS SUPER DELICIOUS 
YOU1000000040_S0000013	SO THIS IS LAHMACUN NOW I RECKON IT IS CALLED TURKISH PIZZA BECAUSE IT'S ROUND IT'S MADE UP OF DOUGH AND THE DOUGH HAS GOT SOME TOPPING ON IT BUT IT IS REALLY DIFFERENT IN MY OPINION 
YOU1000000040_S0000014	IT TAKE A SMALL A CLUMP OF DOUGH AND THEY ROLL THAT DOUGH OUT UNTIL IT'S REALLY THIN PAPER-THIN AND THEN THEY SMEAR IT WITH A THIN MINCED MIXTURE OF LAMB PARSLEY I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF CHILI ON THERE 
YOU1000000040_S0000015	AND THEN THEY POP IT INTO A REALLY BLAZING HOT WOOD-FIRED OVEN NOW YOU CAN SEE THAT THE DOUGH IS JUST PERFECTLY BLISTERED AND IN IT'S GOT THAT WHOLE MINCED MEAT MIXTURE ON THE TOP 
YOU1000000040_S0000016	BUT IT'S SO THIN THAT YOU CAN SEE LIKE PARTS OF THE DOUGH COMING THROUGH SO THE WAY THAT IT'S SERVED IS IT COMES WITH FRESH PARSLEY AND SOME LEMON SO WHAT YOU DO IS YOU GRAB SOME PARSLEY POP IT IN THE MIDDLE 
YOU1000000040_S0000018	AND THEN GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF SQUEEZE OF LEMON OVER THE TOP OF IT AND YOU TAKE THE WHOLE THING AND YOU ROLL IT UP SO YOU WOULDN'T THINK THAT THE DOUGH IS VERY PLIABLE BUT IT IS 
YOU1000000040_S0000019	IT'S LIKE BEAUTIFULLY SOFT ALRIGHT LET'S GIVE THIS THING A TASTE 
YOU1000000040_S0000021	THAT IS SO GOOD IT IS BEAUTIFUL THE DOUGH IS SO SOFT BUT IT HAS THE PERFECT AMOUNT OF CRISPINESS IT'S ALMOST A LITTLE BIT FLOURY BUT IN A PLEASANT WAY 
YOU1000000040_S0000022	AND THE MINCED MEAT MIXTURE THE LAMB IT'S GOT SO MUCH FLAVOR AND THERE'S JUST ENOUGH ON THERE THERE'S THE PERFECT BALANCE OF UM MEAT AND UM DOUGH

YOU1000000044_S0000736	SO LONG STORY SHORT WE ARE IN THE GAS BAY AND THE NICELY THING ABOUT THAT TRAIN IS THAT UP UNTIL A COUPLE YEARS AGO IT WASN'T AN ACTIVE RAILWAY VIA RAIL WASN'T GOING THROUGH THERE 
YOU1000000044_S0000737	PRIOR TO THAT WAS THE C N THEY ALREADY PRIVATIZED THE FREIGHT BUT THEN THERE WAS A PROBLEM WITH ONE OF THE TRESTLES AND THEREFORE THEY SHUT DOWN ALL AH PASSENGER

YOU1000000044_S0001324	AND IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE IT WAS SO AMAZING THERE FIRST TIME 
YOU1000000044_S0001325	HELSINKI FINLAND WAS ACTUALLY ONE ON MY BUCKET LIST PLACES I ALWAYS PICK THE COLD ONES WHICH IS WEIRD COMING FROM CANADA BUT 
YOU1000000044_S0001326	IS IT WARM THIS EVENING IN CALIFORNIA HAZEL YEAH I WAS AH SO MY PARTING TIP ALWAYS SHOOT A SECOND TAKE 
YOU1000000044_S0001327	MY SECOND TAKE SAVE ME FROM RE SHOOT LAST NIGHT DEFINITELY SURE GLAD I HAD THE FOOTAGE HO YOU GOT THAT RIGHT 
YOU1000000044_S0001328	AH THE VIDEO I JUST DID RECENTLY AH BIKER BUSHCRAFT OBVIOUSLY HAS SEEN IT SHE BROUGHT BACK THE EIGHTIES TO MONTREAL 
YOU1000000044_S0001329	THERE'S SOME PANNING SHOTS OF THE CITY MY POOR SON I THINK HE WAS PULLING HIS HAIR AT ONE POINT CAUSE WE WERE LITERALLY DOWN THERE FOR TWO HOURS 
YOU1000000044_S0001330	AND WE ENDED UP WITH OVER FIFTY SOME SHOTS OF EACH SECTION JUST BECAUSE IT'S THAT TIME OF EVENING WHEN IT'S HARD TO GUESS WHAT THE LIGHTNINGS GONNA BE LIKE 
YOU1000000044_S0001331	WHAT IT WILL LOOK LIKE ONCE YOU PUT IT THROUGH THE EDITING BOX AND LIKE YOU SAY THAT THEY DO GET LOST SO YES DEFINITELY ALWAYS BACKUP EVERYTHING 
YOU1000000044_S0001332	'CAUSE YOU'LL NEVER RECREATE THAT MOMENT NOW MAYBE YOU'LL GO AND SHOOT IT EVEN BETTER BUT MOST TIMES YEAH YOU'LL NEVER RECREATE THAT MOMENT SO DEFINITELY DOUBLE UP 
YOU1000000044_S0001333	TRIPLE UP IF YOU CAN 
YOU1000000044_S0001334	AH THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF THE DIGITAL AH TECHNOLOGY IS NOW THAT WE CAN DO THAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001335	YOU KNOW WHEN WE WERE USING EIGHT MILLIMETERS 
YOU1000000044_S0001336	YEAH 
YOU1000000044_S0001337	AH OUR FILM IN THE CAMERA FOR PHOTOS AH UNFORTUNATELY YOU WEREN'T ABLE TO DO THAT AND FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY SOME MAY SAY 
YOU1000000044_S0001338	AH NOW YOU CAN DO AS MANY TAKES OR AS MANY PICTURES AS POSSIBLE AND IF YOU CAN DO IT AND THEN YOU CAN CHOOSE THE BEST ONE 
YOU1000000044_S0001339	EVEN FORGET A PHOTOGRAPHER JUST SOMEBODY WENT TO A WEDDING AND THEY ARE SITTING THERE WITH A ROLL OF THEIR FILM IN THERE THREE OR FIVE MILLIMETERS WE ALL REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS LIKE YOU KNOW 
YOU1000000044_S0001340	YOUR WAITING AND WAITING WAITING FOR A PERFECT SHOOT CAUSE YOU ONLY HAD AH THREE SHOOTS LEFT ON YOUR CAMERA 
YOU1000000044_S0001342	YEAH YEAH I LIKE THAT BIKER BUSHCRAFT L O L EVERY ONE IS PERFECT AND TILL YOU ARE AT POST HOW TRUE IS THAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001343	HOW MANY TIMES YOU LOOK AT THE SCREEN AND THOUGHT YEAH THAT THIS IS THIS IS A KILLER SHOT TILL YOU GET HOME AND THAT LOOKS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE OR YOU LOST IT THAT IT THAT'S THE TRUTH 
YOU1000000044_S0001344	AS MANY PROFESSIONALS SAY I THINK AH TO HAVE TO DO THE MOST PREPARATION BEFORE AH SHOT AH AS POSSIBLE 
YOU1000000044_S0001345	THE MOST YOU CAN DO BEFORE IS BETTER IF THERE IS SOMETHING YOU CAN DO IN POST GREAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001346	BUT THE MORE YOU DO WITH THE LIGHT WITH COMPOSITION WITH THE WAY YOU'RE MOVING YOUR CAMERA THAT LIKE EVERYTHING WHICH YOU CAN DO BEFORE IT AND MAKE SURE BEFORE WE ACTUALLY SHOOT IF ITS POSSIBLE 
YOU1000000044_S0001347	AH PREPARATION IS THE KEY LOTS OF PREPARATION YEAH AND SCOUTING THE PLACE OUT IF I HAVE A NEW PLACE THAT I WANT TO SHOOT I WILL DEFINITELY WALK ALL ROUND IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001348	I'LL LOOK FOR THINGS ARE GONNA LOOK HORRIBLE LATER ON IN FILM I'VE SEEN MYSELF PICKING UP GARBAGE BY A TRAIN YARD ONE TIME LITERALLY I PICKED UP PROBABLY TWENTY-FIVE PIECES 
YOU1000000044_S0001349	IT WAS AN AMAZING PLACE TO SHOOT BUT OF COURSE LITTER WAS BLOWING OFF THE HIGHWAY AND YES YOU MIGHT NOT NOTICE AS MUCH WE'RE LOOKING THROUGH THE CAMERA 
YOU1000000044_S0001350	BUT WHEN YOU GET INTO POST LIKE LIKE BIKER SAYS THEN IT REALLY STICKS OUT 
YOU1000000044_S0001351	AND THAT'S AN AWFUL THING WHEN YOU PUT ALL TWO THREE HOURS WORK INTO SOMETHING JUST BRING HIM BACK AND IT'S ALL NON USABLE 
YOU1000000044_S0001353	DEFINITELY AND I THINK THAT IS THESE DETAILS THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE AS YOU SAID PICKING UP THE GARBAGE 
YOU1000000044_S0001354	IT'S NOTICING THE DETAILS THAT MIGHT BE DISTRACTING IN YOUR VIDEO OR PHOTO AH AND GETTING RID OF THEM 
YOU1000000044_S0001355	AH MAKING IT JUST A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT YOU KNOW AH THOSE DETAILS IS WHAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE 
YOU1000000044_S0001356	UM 
YOU1000000044_S0001357	WHEN YOU WATCH THE VIDEO OR PHOTO 
YOU1000000044_S0001358	LIKE I DON'T DO MUCH PHOTOGRAPHY AS XENYA BUT WHEN I TAKE PHOTOS I KINDA DO SAME AS I DO WITH VIDEO 
YOU1000000044_S0001359	I AH THE WINDMILL TRAIN THAT WAS BROUGHT UP A WHILE AGO AH THAT'S A GREAT EXAMPLE THERE'S A SHOOT IN THE TOWN WHERE I GREW UP A PEAK WHERE IT'S LOOKING THE TRAINS IS CROSSING THE TRESTLE BRIDGE 
YOU1000000044_S0001360	THERE WAS LOTS OF OPEN PLACES THE SHOOT IT BUT IT WAS SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING I WENT DOWN BY THE BANK AND YOU HAVE AH POPLAR TREES THEY WERE COME OFF INTERTWINED A BIT 
YOU1000000044_S0001361	I BENT BACK A COUPLE THEM I TRY NOT TO BREAK THEM IN HALF TO SO WHEN I SHOT I HAVE SOME TREES IN FRONT OF IT YOU KNOW SOME NICE LITTLE BRANCHES 
YOU1000000044_S0001362	AND THAT'S SO MANY PEOPLE TRY TO GO FOR THIS LIKE CRYSTAL CLEAR UNOBSTRUCTED VIEW 
YOU1000000044_S0001363	BUT WHEN YOU SHOOT LIKE THAT YOU HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF BRANCHES HERE AND THERE IT GIVES YOU THAT PEEPING FEEL THAT PEOPLE LOVE LIKE THEY THEY FOUND SOMETHING SPECIAL 
YOU1000000044_S0001364	AND IT REALLY REALLY BRINGS OUT YOUR SHOT AH IT MAKES THE SUBJECT SO MUCH MORE INTERESTING 
YOU1000000044_S0001365	YOU GONNA REMEMBER THAT THE SHOOT THAT IS TAKEN FROM STANDING AND EYE LEVEL IS THE MOST COMMON SHOOT YOU GONNA EVER SEE ANYWHERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001366	YES 
YOU1000000044_S0001367	SO AH BEFORE YOU'RE TAKING A VIDEO OR A PHOTO THINK ABOUT THAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001368	IF YOU'RE STANDING AND YOU'RE DOING THIS PROBABLY THOUSAND TWO-THOUSAND THREE-THOUSAND PEOPLE ALREADY DID THAT ESPECIALLY IT'S SUMMER AND THE TOURIST PLACE 
YOU1000000044_S0001369	SO ONCE YOU DO THIS REMEMBER THAT AND TRY TO GO EITHER LOWER OR ARE IN A DIFFERENT ANGLE OF JUST JUST SO IT'S DIFFERENT 
YOU1000000044_S0001370	BECAUSE AFTER EVENLY WITH THE BEST POST EDIT AH THERE IS GONNA TO BE THOUSANDS OF PICTURES OF A STRAIGHT UP LAKE LOUISE STRAIGHT UP AH GRAND CANYON 
YOU1000000044_S0001371	AND ALL THE OTHER PLACES IT COULD EVER IMAGINE 
YOU1000000044_S0001372	DEFINITELY 
YOU1000000044_S0001373	SO YES WHEN YOU THINK THINK THIS MOVE 
YOU1000000044_S0001374	YES SHOOT UNDER YOUR LEG 
YOU1000000044_S0001375	EVEN IT CAME ON A TINY BIT BLURRY IN ONE CORNER WILL GIVE MORE PERSPECTIVE CAUSE THE ANGLE WAS SHOT FROM VERSUS A STRAIGHT ON ONE THAT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR 
YOU1000000044_S0001376	AH VIDEO I ALMOST ALWAYS SHOOT AH AS MY CAMERAS WELL BUT I'M ALMOST ALWAYS SHOOTING AT CHEST LEVEL 
YOU1000000044_S0001377	AND THAT'S KINDA GIVE A IN BETWEEN VIEW OF CHILD AND ADULT AH MOST ANIMALS WOULD SEE FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE 
YOU1000000044_S0001378	SO I THINK IT'S THE MOST RELATABLE TO MOST PEOPLE THAT ARE WATCHING YOUR WORK NOW IS THAT ALWAYS THE CASE TIME WILL TELL BUT 
YOU1000000044_S0001379	FOR ME I JUST FOUND THAT'S KIND OF WHAT'S WORKED AT THE BEST FOR MYSELF 
YOU1000000044_S0001381	AH ANOTHER TIPS OF TAKING PICTURES BY THE WAY JUMP TO MIND BECAUSE YOU ARE SAYING ABOUT THE CHEST LEVEL 
YOU1000000044_S0001382	AH IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A NICE AND CLEAR PICTURE AH TRY TO HOLD THE CAMERA NOT IN A STRAIGHT OUT HANDS BUT AS CLOSE AS POSSIBLE TO YOUR BODY 
YOU1000000044_S0001383	BASICALLY YOUR BODY IS A TRIPOD 
YOU1000000044_S0001384	YEAH DEFINITELY FOR SURE 
YOU1000000044_S0001385	AH LOTS PEOPLE DO THEY DO THIS BECAUSE WE CAN SEE THE BACK OF THE SCREEN WITH THE VIEW WE WANT TO SEE WHAT IS THERE RIGHT 
YOU1000000044_S0001386	DON'T DO THAT THAT'S WHERE YOU HANDS START GET SHAKY AND 
YOU1000000044_S0001387	YOU HAVE NO CONTROL 
YOU1000000044_S0001388	OH NO CONTROL AT ALL THE CLOSER YOU ARE TO YOUR BODY WITH THAT THE BETTER THE PICTURE NOR THE VIDEO IS BECAUSE IT WORKS LIKE A TRIPOD 
YOU1000000044_S0001389	AND YES THAT IS FAN BOY TALK ONCE AGAIN WE'LL BRING UP PETER MCKENNA HE GAVE A GREAT EXAMPLE FOR HOW HE WAS DOING THE DROPPING SHOTS 
YOU1000000044_S0001390	WAS TO PUT THE CAMERA AH STRAP AROUND YOUR NECK HOLD YOUR CAMERA OUT SO THAT YOU DO HAVE SOME SUPPORT ALREADY YOU KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO FAR AWAY 
YOU1000000044_S0001391	ADJUST YOUR STRAPS WHICH IS ABOUT HERE WHICH IS USUALLY FOR MOST PEOPLE LIFTING UP THEIR CAMERA YOU GONNA SHOOT AH JUST ON ONE FOOT JUST OFF JUST PIVOT AHEAD 
YOU1000000044_S0001392	AND YOU ONLY HAVE ABOUT TWO THREE SECONDS BUT YOU COULD ACTUALLY CATCH A LOT IN THAT TWO THREE SECONDS 
YOU1000000044_S0001393	AND YOU GOT A NICE PANNING SHOTS OF YOU WANNA LIKE A FLOWER OR MAYBE A SMALL BROOK SOMEWHERE AND YOU WANT TO GET THAT NICE PANNING SHOT IS DOING THAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001394	JUST LET YOURSELF STANDING ON ONE FOOT AND LET YOURSELF JUST LIGHTLY GO AHEAD ON YOUR OWN MOMENTUM AND YOU CAN REALLY GET SOME GREAT SHOOT 
YOU1000000044_S0001395	AND DO THAT FROM DIFFERENT ANGLES HOLD THE CAMERA WITH AH WITH THE SLUNG AH THE STRAP AND JUST TURN IT SLOWLY 
YOU1000000044_S0001396	YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT FOREVER BUT YOU UM YOU'LL ALWAYS KNOW YOU KEEP THAT LITTLE BIT OF STEADY MOMENTUM AS YOU DO IT AND THAT REALLY HELPS A LOT 
YOU1000000044_S0001398	AH HAZEL IS ASKING IF WE'RE CARRYING AROUND CHARGE BATTERIES 
YOU1000000044_S0001399	DEFINITELY ALL KINDS OF CHARGED BATTERIES 
YOU1000000044_S0001400	LET ME COUNT AH OKAY SO ONE IS ALWAYS IN THE CAMERA CHARGED 
YOU1000000044_S0001401	AH EVER EVERY TIME I COME BACK FROM SOMEWHERE WHERE I HAD GONE TO SHOOT I COME BACK AND I CHARGE RIGHT AWAY THE THE BATTERIES 
YOU1000000044_S0001402	THAT'S JUST A GIVEN SO THERE'S ALWAYS ONE CHARGED INSIDE AND I THINK I HAVE FOUR OR FIVE EXTRA 
YOU1000000044_S0001403	SHE'S NEVER A SHORTAGE OF THEM THAT'S FOR SURE 
YOU1000000044_S0001404	WHY BECAUSE WE SOMETIMES SHOOT WEDDINGS AND BELIEVE ME I GO THROUGH ALL OF THEM AND SOME TIMES EVEN NEED TO CHARGE EXTRA 
YOU1000000044_S0001405	AND AH THAT'S LITHIUM BATTERY ON THE SONY CAMERA THAT I'M USING 
YOU1000000044_S0001406	AH SO AH THAT'S A LOT THAT'S A LOT OF BATTERIES TO GO THROUGH AH IN A EIGHT HOUR SOME TIMES 
YOU1000000044_S0001407	AH BUT AND WHY BY THE WAY BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES AS A WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER OR EVENT PHOTOGRAPHER WE GO TO BAPTISM 
YOU1000000044_S0001408	BY THE WAY WE WILL HAVE A SHOOT ON AH ON THIS SUNDAY YES SUNDAY 
YOU1000000044_S0001409	AH I DON'T WANT TO LOSE A SHOT SO I OFTENTIMES JUST KEEP AH THE SHUTTER OPEN AND JUST WAIT FOR THE FOR THE RIGHT MOMENT 
YOU1000000044_S0001410	I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THEIR MOTION OR THEIR FACE EXPRESSION SO I JUST KEEP IT OPEN OBVIOUSLY BATTERIES DRAINING AS I AM DOING THAT AND 
YOU1000000044_S0001411	THAT'S WHY I SOMETIMES GO THROUGH FIVE SIX OF THEM AH DURING THE EVENT 
YOU1000000044_S0001412	BUT YES WE DEFINITELY ALWAYS ALWAYS EXTRA CHARGING BATTERIES EVEN WITH THE PHONE CHARGERS ALWAYS WITH ME AND WE CHARGE AH CHARGES IN THE CAR 
YOU1000000044_S0001413	BECAUSE I AH YOU KNOW IT'S NOT FOR BEING ABLE TO TALK THROUGH IT BUT TO TO TAKE PICTURES EVEN WITH A PHONE WHEN I DON'T HAVE MY CAMERA WITH ME WHAT ABOUT YOU 
YOU1000000044_S0001414	AH ME I KEEP FIVE FOUR BATTERIES AND MINE IS A BIT TRICKY FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT THE CONTROLLER IS MY CELLPHONE THAT'S HOW THAT ONE IS CONTROLLED 
YOU1000000044_S0001415	SO I HAVE TO KEEP EXTRA BATTERIES FOR THE CELL PHONE PLUS EXTRA BATTERIES FOR THE CAMERA ITSELF 
YOU1000000044_S0001416	AH THE FOUR LITHIUM BATTERIES FOR THE CAMERA AS SOON AS ONE RUNS OUT I AM LITERALLY PLUG IN AND CHARGING IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001417	AND I WILL TRY ALL DAY I WILL PLANTED OUT SO WHEN WE DO A WEDDING I'LL LOOK AROUND AND SEE THE DIFFERENT AREAS WE'RE GOING TO BE FILMING WHERE THE PLUGINS ARE AVAILABLE AND I ALWAYS TRY TO RESERVE THEM IN ADVANCE 
YOU1000000044_S0001418	I'LL ASK THE D J OR I'LL ASK CONCIERGE'S WHOEVER HAS ANY CONTROL OVER THEM THAT AT LEAST SAVED ME ONE 
YOU1000000044_S0001419	AND FROM THERE I AM JUST PLUGGING IN RECHARGING I'D NEVER TAKE A CHANCE I I SHOULD GET MORE BATTERIES REALLY 
YOU1000000044_S0001420	AH FOUR SEEMS TO WORK OKAY CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN LUCKY TO PLUG THEM IN BUT AT SOME POINT UP MY LUCKS GONNA RUN OUT 
YOU1000000044_S0001421	AND IT DOES YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN MAGIC WENT REMEMBER WE HAD A WEDDING ONE TIME WELL THE ONE WITH JEFFREY IN THEM

YOU1000000044_S0001460	AH I WOULD SAY SO USUALLY THERE IS AT ANY GIVEN TIME

YOU1000000044_S0001475	AND THAT'S WHY I WAS COMING BACK AND WATCHING OTHER VIDEOS BECAUSE OF THAT AND THUMBNAIL 
YOU1000000044_S0001476	YEAH THUMBNAILS ARE SO IMPORTANT AND WE ALL KINDA MAKE THAT MISTAKE THERE I'VE BEEN THERE MANY TIMES 
YOU1000000044_S0001477	THE THUMBNAILS THAT YOU SEE FOR OUR VIDEOS I'VE REDONE I THINK IT'S FOR TIMES NOW TO GET THEM WHERE I WANT TO GET THEM 
YOU1000000044_S0001478	AND SOME THINGS I'VE LEARNED LIKE AH ONE OF MY FAVORITE ONES IS THE ONE OF LATEST ONES WE DID WAS THE TRAIN IN THE FOG IN KINGSTON ONTARIO 
YOU1000000044_S0001479	BEFORE I WOULD HAVE TAKEN A SCREEN SHOT IT WOULD'VE BEEN FURTHER BACK 
YOU1000000044_S0001480	YES YOU CAN SEE THE TRAIN YES YOU COULD PROBABLY GUESSED THERE WAS A BIT FOG IN THERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001481	BUT NOW IF YOU LOOK AT IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001482	BECAUSE THE THUMBNAIL SMALLER I ADDED I TAKE THE SHOT BRINGING INTO PHOTOSHOP THE FIRST THING I DO IS I UP THE CONTRAST A LOT 
YOU1000000044_S0001483	BECAUSE IT'S SMALLER I REALLY WANTED THE PUNCH THEN I BRING UP THE BLACKS SO THE SHADOWS I STILL WANT YOU TO SEE DETAIL 
YOU1000000044_S0001484	BUT I WANT TO GET TO THE EXACT POINT THE SWEETEST SPOT WHERE IT'S AS JET BLACK AS CAN BE WHILE YOU CAN STILL MAKE OUT WHAT'S IN THERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001485	AND THEN AH THE FOG WAS ACTUALLY MY GOD I FEEL LIKE IT'S A DRINKING GAMES SO I'AM GONNA BRING UP PETER MCKENNA ONE MORE TIME 
YOU1000000044_S0001486	BUT TALK ABOUT GETTING IDEAS WE WERE WATCHING AND HE WAS SHOWN ABOUT HOW TO DO AH MOTION BLUR TO GIVE YOUR PICTURE MORE DEPTH 
YOU1000000044_S0001487	AND THAT I'VE DONE THAT BEFORE BUT I HADN'T DONE SO LONG AND I'VE SEEN IT AND TWO DAYS WHILE I WAS WORKING THUMBNAIL I THOUGHT THAT'S IT THAT'S WHAT I'M MISSING 
YOU1000000044_S0001488	SO I TOOK THE SHOT THEN LAYERED ON TOP OF EACH OTHER AND THEN I ADDED THE MOTION BLUR TO IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001489	AND STARTED AS A LAYER MASK CLEANING IT OUT AND GAVE IT THAT MASK WITH A TRAIN COMES PUNCHING THROUGH THE FOG 
YOU1000000044_S0001490	BECAUSE PEOPLE AREN'T GONNA SEE THE BIG PICTURE THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON TO AT THE TIME 
YOU1000000044_S0001491	LIKE YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN THEY'RE LITERALLY SEEING THIS AT THE BEST OF TIMES 
YOU1000000044_S0001492	SO HI RES VERY VERY HIGH CONTRAST PICTURES IS WHAT WORKS GREAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001493	AND THAT PICTURE LIKE XENYA SAID THAT WAS THE SEAGULL THAT YOU NAILED IT THERE REALLY NAIL THAT AND USE THAT AS YOUR EXAMPLE AND GO BACK AND DO YOUR THUMBNAILS 
YOU1000000044_S0001494	UM I NOTICE YOUR BOTTLE CAP LOGO I LIKE IT IT'S VERY PUNCHY 
YOU1000000044_S0001495	I WOULD ALMOST THOUGH CONSIDER MAYBE FINDING THE SPOT THAT YOU LIKE TO USE AND USE IT AT THE SAME PLACE ON ALL YOUR PHOTOS 
YOU1000000044_S0001496	LIKE IF YOU NOTICE OURS HAS PUSHA STUDIO WITH THE WHITE BAND ACROSS THE BOTTOM AND USUALLY THE FOUR K ON TOP 
YOU1000000044_S0001497	EXCEPT FOR A FEW OF THEM WHERE I DID A PHOTO SERIES OR THAT THE HOUR LONG TRAIN I COULDN'T MAKE IT INTO FOUR K IT WAS TOO LONG 
YOU1000000044_S0001498	AND ALL IT IS IS ONE PHOTOSHOP DOCUMENT I BACK UP OF COURSE 
YOU1000000044_S0001499	BUT WITH EVERY LAYER IS ALL OF THEM PHOTO THOSE THUMBNAILS 
YOU1000000044_S0001500	AND I ALWAYS JUST GO IN AND ADD A NEW LAYER OR A NEW FOLDER IN THERE AND WORK ON THAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001501	SO EVERYTHING ALWAYS STAYS IN THE SAME UNIFORM SCALE EVERY TIME 
YOU1000000044_S0001502	SO THE FOUR K LOGO IS ALWAYS THE SAME PLACE THE BANNER IS ALWAYS IN THE SAME PLACE AND THE ONLY THING THAT CHANGES IS THE LAYERS BEHIND IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001503	MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE AH ONE OF HIS VIDEOS IF YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR 
YOU1000000044_S0001504	YEAH

YOU1000000044_S0001538	YEAH YEAH YEAH OH YEAH THE QUESTION IS FROM WHICH MOVIE 
YOU1000000044_S0001540	BOTTLE CAPS WILL DEFINITELY BE PICKING SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO OKAY SO LET'S SEE HERE AH BEAR WITH ME I WANT TO GET IT SET UP 
YOU1000000044_S0001542	THIS WILL BE ANOTHER FIRST 
YOU1000000044_S0001544	AH APPLICATIONS SCREEN SHARE 
YOU1000000044_S0001545	OKAY NOW WE ARE GONNA TRY THE SOUND I HOPE THIS WORKS OKAY 
YOU1000000044_S0001547	GREAT SHOT 
YOU1000000044_S0001549	GREAT OPENING SHOT 
YOU1000000044_S0001551	THAT THAT THAT OPENING SHOT IS ABSOLUTELY AH I DON'T SEE ANY PROBLEM WITH IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001552	AH I LOVED THE MOVEMENT I LOVE THE PAUSE IN THE BEGINNING THE COMPOSITION OF THE SHOT THE SET UP IS GREAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001553	AH I WOULD WORK A LITTLE BIT ON THE HISTOGRAM 
YOU1000000044_S0001554	YEAS COLOR THAT'S WHY I SAID SHOT SPECIFICALLY MEANING THAT THEY DID THAT THE DIRECTION YOU ARE GOING INTO I KNOW XENYA WOULD TALK ABOUT COLOR 
YOU1000000044_S0001555	AH AS YOU NOTICE RIGHT HERE IN THE SPOT YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE IS 
YOU1000000044_S0001557	SO YOU CAN SEE THE ONLY THING RIGHT NOW IS YOUR MISSING IS SOME DEFINITION BETWEEN YOUR CLOUDS YOUR WATER AND YOUR GRASS 
YOU1000000044_S0001558	IT'S A NICE SHOT AND REALLY IT'S NOT A TON OF AH HE DOESN'T NEED A REBUILDING OR ANYTHING IT'S JUST AS JUST BRING UP YOUR BLACKS A BIT MORE 
YOU1000000044_S0001559	YOU KNOW FROM THE GRASS HERE THAT AH WATERSIDE GRASS IT WOULD MAKE THEM MORE DEFINED THAT WAY 
YOU1000000044_S0001560	ME PERSONALLY I WOULD BOOST UP YOUR BLACKS A BIT AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S A NICE BLUE SKY I WOULD BRING BACK MAYBE EVEN A BIT OF A YELLOW TINT JUST A TINY BIT 
YOU1000000044_S0001561	JUST TO KIND OF BRING A LITTLE LITTLE LITTLE BIT OF LIFE INTO THE PLANTS OVER THERE OR TRY YOUR GREENS A BIT 
YOU1000000044_S0001562	BUT USUALLY YELLOW GIVES YOU A MORE CINEMATIC LOOK BUT YOU DON'T ADD TOO MUCH OF IT AND THAT'S A BIG KEY AND THIS IS A SIDE NOTE 
YOU1000000044_S0001563	THAT HAPPENS A LOT WHEN PEOPLE GET CRAZY WITH THE SLIDER THEY START MOVING AT LEFT RIGHT AS FAR AS IT CAN GO 
YOU1000000044_S0001564	ALMOST EVERYTHING YOU DO SHOULD BE WITHIN MAYBE WHAT TEN PERCENT I WOULD SAY IS A GOOD NUMBER TO KEEP IN MIND 
YOU1000000044_S0001565	'CAUSE YOU WILL DISTORTED SO BADLY IN THE END THEY WON'T EVEN LOOK RECOGNIZABLE ANYMORE 
YOU1000000044_S0001566	YEAH AH YEAH MY SUGGESTION WOULD BE BRINGING THE HIGHLIGHT A LITTLE BIT DOWN AND BRINGING THE SHADOWS A BIT UP 
YOU1000000044_S0001567	THE TRICK IN GETTING THE DETAIL BUT NOT GETTING YOUR SHOT TOO TOO DARK IS GETTING YOUR SHADOWS A LITTLE BIT UP 
YOU1000000044_S0001568	IT'S NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH TO BLOW IT OUT COMPLETELY 
YOU1000000044_S0001569	BUT IT'S GONNA GIVE THAT NICE AH DETAIL IN THE IN THE DARKEST PARTS AH AS FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUR TREES HERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001570	AH THAT WOULD BE MORE VISIBLE 
YOU1000000044_S0001571	AND ALSO AH HERE MAYBE THE HIGHLIGHTS ARE GOOD I WOULD EVEN SAY AH THEY'RE GREAT 
YOU1000000044_S0001572	BUT RIGHT HERE IF YOU WOULD JUST PUT THE HIGHLIGHTS A LITTLE BIT DOWN 
YOU1000000044_S0001573	I WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE MORE OF THE WATER MORE OF THE CLOUDS MORE OF THAT BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL SCENERY IN THE BACKGROUND THERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001574	AH SO YEAH SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY WITH REGARDS TO THAT AND WE CAN PLAY IT ALONG AGAIN WHERE ARE WE OKAY 
YOU1000000044_S0001576	YEAH BEAUTIFUL MOVEMENT THE COMPOSITION OF THE SHOT IS AMAZING 
YOU1000000044_S0001578	AND YOU SEE RIGHT AWAY HEAR YOU'RE DOING WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE DOING ONLINE 
YOU1000000044_S0001579	NOT TO DEGRADE YOUR WORK SAYING THAT YOU YOU DON'T NEED TO FEEL LIKE YOU YOU'RE A MADE SOME SERVE ABOMINATION 
YOU1000000044_S0001580	LOOK AT THE PASS ON THE BIRDS YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT CONTRAST THOSE BIRDS WILL POP RIGHT OUT OF THE WATER 
YOU1000000044_S0001582	YOU HAVE GREAT SHOOT HERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001583	NICE SPEED NOT TOO FAST NOT TOO SLOW AMAZING 
YOU1000000044_S0001584	HERE'S OH RIGHT HERE HERE'S WHAT I WOULD AVOID AND THIS IS COMMON WITH MOST DRONE SHOTS EVERYTHING WAS FLOWING I WANT TO PUT THIS BACK 
YOU1000000044_S0001585	LET ME SEE A BIT FURTHER CAUSE I WANNA CATCH IT WHERE IT HAPPENS AND YOU SEE THE FLOW YOU HAD SINCE YOU LEFT LAND 
YOU1000000044_S0001586	AND YOU WENT OUT THERE BEAUTIFUL RIGHT HERE WHERE YOU ARE STARTING TO TURN THAT'S WHERE I WOULD FADE OUT 
YOU1000000044_S0001587	I WOULD NEVER KEEP THAT TURN IN THERE AND AS YOU TURN HERE ONCE YOU STRAIGHTENED OUT AND YOU FIND YOUR ANGLE THAT YOU'RE GOING IN 
YOU1000000044_S0001589	THAT'S WHERE I WOULD BE BRINGING THE VIDEO BACK IN LIKE HERE LIKE AH LET'S GO BACK SEE HOW YOU KINDA PANTING UP SLOWLY 
YOU1000000044_S0001590	YOU COULD USE THAT AS A SHOT CUTTING OUT ALL THE MIDDLE BETWEEN WHERE I HAD STOPPED IN HERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001591	THIS IS NICE IT'S GETTING 
YOU1000000044_S0001593	THE PROBLEM WITH DRONES AND THIS HAS BEEN A BIG BIG ARGUMENT FOR A WHILE 
YOU1000000044_S0001595	IF YOU'RE MAKING A VIDEO YOU JUST WANT TO SHOW FLYING A DRONE IN AN AREA LEAVE IT IT'S GOOD 
YOU1000000044_S0001596	IF YOU WANT TO MAKE IT MORE CINEMATIC THINK OF ALL THE MOVIES YOU HAVE SEEN WHERE THERE HAS BEEN A LIFTED CAMERA 
YOU1000000044_S0001597	THEY NEVER SHOW ALL THE TURNINGS CAUSE I MEAN A DRONE IS NOT A PERFECT TURN WHEN IT DOES ONE IS VERY VERY DISJOINTED 
YOU1000000044_S0001598	AS IT'S TURNING IT'S RISING AND DOESN'T QUITE KNOW WHERE TO GO AND STEADYING OUT 
YOU1000000044_S0001599	CUT OUT THE FAT REMEMBER I WAS SAYING WITH MY CAMERA I NEVER SHOOT A BUILDING I WANTED STRAIGHT ON I ALWAYS START AWAY FROM IT AND PAN ACROSS IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001600	BECAUSE I'LL ACTUALLY CUT OUT THAT BEGINNING PART WHERE I STARTED AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT JITTERY AND WAIT TILL THE MOVEMENT IS FLUID AND THAT'S WHERE I'LL START MY VIDEO 
YOU1000000044_S0001601	AND WHERE IT'S STARTING TO GET KIND OF GOING THE SAME WAY THE END THAT'S WHERE I'LL CUT OFF 
YOU1000000044_S0001602	AH THAT'S THAT MAKES TONS AND TONS AND TONS A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR FOOTAGE 
YOU1000000044_S0001603	'CAUSE YOU GOT A GREAT FOOTAGE RIGHT HERE THIS TURN YOU CAN USE THAT AND THEN MAY BE CUT IT AGAIN AFTERWARDS 
YOU1000000044_S0001605	SEE LIKE THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PANNING SHOTS LIKE THIS YOU CAN USE 
YOU1000000044_S0001607	BUT YOU GOT A SEPARATE THEM WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE MOVING OFF AND THE DRONE IS STEADYING ITSELF CUT IT OUT 
YOU1000000044_S0001608	AND MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE TO SKIP FIVE SECONDS BUT AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE GOOD FOOTAGE AND THEN YOU CAN SHOW IT HERE 
YOU1000000044_S0001609	SO STARTING WITH THAT I WOULD DO THE FIRST TURN AND THEN SEE THAT THERE WAS BIT OF JITTERING AND ANOTHER NICE TURN BUT ALMOST THE SAME LEVEL 
YOU1000000044_S0001610	I WOULD ACTUALLY TAKE THAT NEXT I CUT OUT THE BAD PART AND THE NEXT ONE I WOULD ZOOM IN MAY BE 
YOU1000000044_S0001612	OR ZOOM OUT AS WELL AH TWENTY PER CENT SO IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THE SAME KIND CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE A JUMP SHOT WITH THE SAME AH VIEW 
YOU1000000044_S0001613	SO BRINGING IN A BIT MORE OR BRINGING OUT A BIT MORE 
YOU1000000044_S0001615	YEAH YOU DEFINITELY IN DETAIL AND COLOR AH LOOK AT ALL THAT COLOR IN THE WATER LIKE I I JUST WANNA PUNCH IN IT

YOU1000000044_S0001624	YEAH OKAY SEE WHERE THE CAMERA GOT JITTERY RIGHT HERE THAT'S WHERE I WOULD HAVE CUT THAT PART OUT AND THEN MAYBE START HERE IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH DISTANCE AND THE STAYS SMOOTH 
YOU1000000044_S0001625	CUT OUT ALL YOUR JITTERY PARTS AND THEN YOU HAVE THEM ON THE TIME LINE AND FROM THERE YOU HAVE ALL YOUR GOOD CUTS FIGURE HOW YOU WORK THEM INTO THE MUSIC 
YOU1000000044_S0001627	MUSIC IS KEY YOU WANT EVERYTHING TO FOLLOW THE BEAT YOU CAN ZOOM IN AND SEE EVERY NOTE HOW GOES UP AND DOWN AND YOU'LL SEE A PATTERN INTO IT 
YOU1000000044_S0001628	AND FROM THERE YOU CAN AH REALLY SYNC UP WITH MUSIC AND THAT'S THE BIGGEST KEY TO BUILDING SOMETHING REALLY GREAT REALLY QUICK
