1272_128104_000001_000000	A 'JOLLY' ART CRITIC
1272_128104_000003_000000	There is a healthy bank holiday atmosphere about this book which is extremely pleasant.
1272_128104_000003_000001	 soldiers Quilter is entirely free from affectation of any kind.
1272_128104_000003_000002	He rollicks through art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer.
1272_128104_000003_000003	To many, no doubt, he will seem to be somewhat blatant and bumptious, but we prefer to regard him as being simply British.
1272_128104_000003_000005	After listening so long to the Don Quixote of art, to listen once to Sancho Panza is both salutary and refreshing.
1272_128104_000005_000000	About artists and their work mr Quilter has, of course, a great deal to say.
1272_128104_000005_000001	Sculpture he regards as 'Painting's poor relation'; so, with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the 'rough modelling' of Tanagra figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts; but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality.
1272_128104_000005_000006	That there is a difference between colour and colours, that an artist, be he portrait painter or dramatist, always reveals himself in his manner, are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him; but mr Quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art, with the exception of mr Whistler.
1272_128104_000005_000007	Painting, he tells us, is 'of a different quality to mathematics,' and finish in art is 'adding more fact'!
1272_128104_000005_000008	Portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy; however, even for the emotional artist there is hope, as a portrait can be converted into a picture 'by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct'!
1272_128104_000005_000009	As for etchings, they are of two kinds stritish and foreign.
1272_128104_000005_000013	And then the picture he draws of the ideal home, where everything, though ugly, is hallowed by domestic memories, and where beauty appeals not to the heartless eye but the family affections; 'baby's chair there, and the mother's work basket . . . near the fire, and the ornaments Fred brought home from India on the mantel board'!
1272_128104_000005_000014	It is really impossible not to be touched by so charming a description.
1272_128104_000006_000003	Far from it.
1272_128104_000006_000008	On the whole, the book will not do.
1272_128104_000006_000009	We fully admit that it is extremely amusing and, no doubt, mr Quilter is quite earnest in his endeavours to elevate art to the dignity of manual labour, but the extraordinary vulgarity of the style alone will always be sufficient to prevent these Sententiae Artis from being anything more than curiosities of literature. mr Quilter has missed his chance; for he has failed even to make himself the Tupper of Painting.
