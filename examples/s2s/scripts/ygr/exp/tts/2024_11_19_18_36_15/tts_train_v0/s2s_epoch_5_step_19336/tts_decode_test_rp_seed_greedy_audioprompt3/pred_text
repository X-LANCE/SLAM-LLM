1272_128104_000003_000000	There is a healthy bank holiday atmosphere about this book which is extremely pleasant.
1272_128104_000003_000001	mr Quilter is entirely free from affectation of any kind.
1272_128104_000003_000002	He rollicks through art with the recklessness of the tourist and describes its beauties with the enthusiasm of the auctioneer.
1272_128104_000003_000003	To many, no doubt, he will seem to be somewhat blatant and bumptious, but we prefer to regard him as being simply British.
1272_128104_000003_000005	After listening so long to the Don Quixote of art, to listen once to Sancho Panza is both salutary and refreshing.
1272_128104_000005_000000	About artists and their work mr Quilter has, of course, a great deal to say.
1272_128104_000005_000001	Sculpture he regards as 'Painting's poor relation'; so, with the exception of a jaunty allusion to the 'rough modelling' of TanBl figurines he hardly refers at all to the plastic arts; but on painters he writes with much vigour and joviality.
1272_128104_000005_000006	That there is a difference between colour and colours, that an artist, be he portrait painter or dramatist, always reveals himself in his manner, are ideas that can hardly be said to occur to him; but mr Quilter really does his best and bravely faces every difficulty in modern art, with the exception of mr Whistler.
1272_128104_000005_000007	Painting, he tells us, is 'of a different quality to mathematics,' and finish in art is 'adding more fact'!
1272_128104_000005_000008	Portrait painting is a bad pursuit for an emotional artist as it destroys his personality and his sympathy; however, even for the emotional artist there is hope, as a portrait can be converted into a picture 'by adding to the likeness of the sitter some dramatic interest or some picturesque adjunct'!
